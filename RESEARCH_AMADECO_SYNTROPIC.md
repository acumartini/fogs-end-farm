## Project Overview

Amadeco is a syntropic agroforestry project in southern Italy (Adriatic side), led by Felipe Pasini and Diana. The site was chosen as a "mini apocalypse" — degraded soils, reclassified climate, diminished rainfall, salinized water, and an olive disease crisis (Xylella fastidiosa).

**Climate:** Extreme variability
- Winter similar to central Portugal
- Summer similar to southern Spain (45-47°C / 113-117°F)
- At least one snow day per year
- 30cm hail events
- Late frost (through April/May)

This climate profile has similarities to Rogue Valley Zone 7b-8a: hot dry summers, frost risk, variable conditions.

## Key Design Principles

### Layered Planting
- Plant in layers (vertical structure)
- Fast-growing support species protect slower-growing production species
- Successional approach — system matures over time

### Spacing
- Tree lines every 5.2 meters (~17 ft)
- Fruit trees in lines with aromatics between
- Dense aromatic plantings for ground cover and biomass

### Support Species Philosophy
- Support species are not just "nurse trees" — they are part of the system
- Fast-growing species create microclimate (shade, wind protection, humidity)
- Pruning of support species provides biomass/mulch
- Eucalyptus used heavily (not applicable to our zone, but poplar serves similar function)

## Species Mentioned

### Frequently Mentioned
| Species | Count | Role/Notes |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Olive | 54 | Primary crop (but disease issues) |
| Pea | 17 | Cover crop / nitrogen |
| Citrus | 13 | Production (needs protection from cold) |
| Sage/Salvia | 12 | Aromatic, ground cover, fast establishing |
| Oak | 8 | Evergreen oak mentioned for protection |
| Fig | 7 | Production, drought tolerant |
| Wheat | 6 | Cover crop / grain |
| Pomegranate | 5 | Production, drought tolerant |
| Pear | 5 | Production |
| Grape | 5 | Production |
| Strawberry tree | 4 | Support species, evergreen, fruit |
| Rosemary | 4 | Aromatic |
| Cherry | 4 | Production |
| Eucalyptus | 3 | Fast support species (not for our zone) |
| Orange | 3 | Citrus |
| Lavender | 3 | Aromatic |

### Aromatics Specifically Mentioned
- Salvia (sage) — "the problem solver," fast growing
- Melissa (lemon balm)
- Ruta (rue)
- Lavender
- Rosemary
- Artemisia — fast ground cover

### Other Species Noted
- Artichoke
- Pistachio
- Fennel
- Caper
- Oat
- Clover

## Species Potentially Applicable to Zone 7b-8a (Jackson County, OR)

### High Priority to Consider Adding

| Species | Zone | Role | Notes |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| **Pomegranate** | 7-10 | Sub-canopy, fruit | Drought tolerant, mentioned frequently, beautiful |
| **Strawberry tree** (Arbutus unedo) | 7-9 | Support, evergreen | Winter interest, edible fruit, mentioned as support species |
| **Artemisia** | 4-9 | Ground cover, edges | Fast growing, deer resistant, biomass |
| **Melissa** (lemon balm) | 4-9 | Herbaceous, aromatic | Pollinator, spreads easily |
| **Ruta** (rue) | 4-9 | Aromatic, edges | Deer resistant, medicinal |

### Already in Our Plan (Validated)
- Fig ✓
- Oak ✓  
- Pear ✓
- Sage/Salvia ✓
- Lavender ✓
- Comfrey ✓

### Marginal / Needs Protection
- Rosemary — Zone 7 marginal, may need winter protection
- Citrus — too cold for our zone without significant protection

## Design Insights Relevant to Our Project

### Spacing Comparison
| Amadeco | Fogs End |
|---------|----------|
| Tree lines at 5.2m (~17 ft) | Swales at ~55 ft, tree lines on berms |
| Dense aromatics between | Aromatics on berm edges |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Aromatics are workhorses** — Sage especially mentioned as fast-establishing, problem-solving. They use aromatics heavily for ground cover, biomass, and microclimate.

2. **Support species are system members** — Not just temporary; they provide ongoing function through pruning/biomass even as they're thinned.

3. **Dense planting, then thin** — Start dense to establish microclimate quickly, thin as system matures. Matches our approach.

4. **Frost management through layering** — Upper canopy protects understory from frost. Relevant for our late spring frost risk.

5. **Evergreen component** — Strawberry tree and evergreen oak provide winter structure and protection. We could add strawberry tree for this function.

6. **Salvia/sage as establishment species** — Fast, hardy, creates conditions for other plants. We have this in our plan.

## Quotes of Note

> "Working with successional agroforestry... is the way of doing this. Using the dynamics of the Mediterranean forest in order to create conditions to have even agriculture again."

> "The more we studied about the place, the more these conditions were being met because here is also a mini apocalypse."

> "We put very densely and with a lot of varieties of plants and diversity so it could be our classroom to understand what would grow well."

> "Trusting the process, it will eventually rebuild fertility."

## Action Items for Fogs End

- [ ] Consider adding pomegranate to sub-canopy layer
- [ ] Consider adding strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) for evergreen structure
- [ ] Add artemisia to edge plantings
- [ ] Research melissa and ruta as additional aromatic/herbaceous layer
- [ ] Note: Our poplar serves similar function to their eucalyptus (fast support)
