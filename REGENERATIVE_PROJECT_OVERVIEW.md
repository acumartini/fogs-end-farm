# Fogs End Farm: Regenerative Silvopasture Project

**Jackson County, Oregon | 9.5 acres**

---

## The Opportunity

The back 5 acres of this 9.5-acre property is a flood-irrigated pasture with unrealized potential. Currently, the pasture struggles to hold water and support healthy forage. This project transforms the property into an integrated silvopasture system that addresses soil health, water management, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and climate resilience as interconnected outcomes of a regenerative design.

The system integrates contour swales for water management, diverse tree lines for silvopasture, and rotational grazing for pasture and soil health. The swales capture and infiltrate irrigation water, which supports the tree lines. The trees drop organic matter which feeds the pasture and provide shade and forage for animals. Rotational grazing invigorates the pasture, builds soil structure, and cycles nutrients back into the soil. Together these components create a regenerative feedback loop.

An eventual goal of this project is to give back to the community by documenting methods and results, hosting site visits, and propagating proven genetics for regional distribution.

## The Land

The back 5 acres sits on a gentle north-facing slope, roughly 550 ft (E/W on contour) by 400 ft (N/S). An irrigation ditch lines the southern border and is the source of flood irrigation. Two barns provide shelter and storage.

The schematic overlay below shows the proposed layout with seven contour swales dividing the pasture into paddocks:

## The System

Seven contour swales (~400 ft each) run east-west across the pasture. Water enters from the south and flows north by gravity, passing through six opportunities for infiltration before leaving the property. Each swale berm carries a diverse tree line — over 30 species selected for drought tolerance, nitrogen fixation, and livestock compatibility. Between the swales, seven paddocks (~0.5 acres each) support rotational grazing. Short grazing periods, followed by 30+ days of rest, build soil biology through the graze-trample-rest cycle. Deep bedding from winter housing is composted and returned to the pasture, feeding soil biology. Poultry follow ruminant grazing, breaking parasite cycles and adding concentrated nutrients.

### Tree Line Structure

Each swale berm supports a multi-layer tree line designed for long-term productivity and resilience. All species selected for livestock safety — no toxic parts. Fast-growing emergent trees establish shade and microclimate early, then are thinned as the permanent canopy matures.

| Layer | Species | Spacing |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Emergent | Poplar | 30 ft |
| Canopy | Chestnut, honey locust | 40-50 ft |
| Sub-canopy | Mulberry, pear, fig, persimmon, jujube | 15-20 ft |
| Shrub | Serviceberry, hazelnut | 8-10 ft |
| Nitrogen-fixers | Alder, Siberian pea shrub, goumi | Interplanted |
| Swale channel | Willow (coppiced for biomass) | 2-3 ft |
| Edges | Sage, lavender, comfrey, artemisia | 1-2 ft |

### Forage Cascade

Fruit and nut species selected to provide dropped forage from late spring through winter:

| Drop Time | Species | Type |
|-----------|---------|------|
| May-Jun | Mulberry | Fruit |
| Jun | Serviceberry, goumi | Fruit |
| Aug-Sep | Fig, pear | Fruit |
| Sep-Oct | Chestnut, honey locust pods, hazelnut | Nut/Pod |
| Oct-Nov | Persimmon | Fruit |
| Nov-Feb | Jujube | Fruit (dries on tree) |

## Measurable Outcomes

Success will be tracked through the following metrics:

| Metric | Baseline (Year 1) | Target (Year 5) |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Soil health | Establish baseline | Measurable improvement |
| Surface runoff | Establish baseline | Full capture |
| Plant species count | ~5 (grass monoculture) | 30+ perennial species |
| Tree survival rate | N/A | 80%+ establishment |
| Pasture rest days | 0 (continuous) | 30+ days between grazing |
| Carrying capacity | Establish baseline | 25-50% increase |

Soil health testing will establish baseline physical, chemical, and biological indicators. Surface runoff measures how effectively the swales capture irrigation. Plant species count tracks biodiversity across the tree lines and overseeded pasture. Tree survival rate validates that species selection and establishment methods are working. Pasture rest days ensure proper grazing rotation. Carrying capacity is the ultimate indicator of pasture productivity.

## Timeline

The project rolls out in three phases, with major infrastructure in Year 1, system establishment in Years 2-3, and maturation ongoing after Year 5.

**Year 1:** Site preparation and infrastructure
- Blackberry removal in lower pasture
- Earthwork: 7 contour swales, access roads, subsoiling
- Fencing: perimeter upgrade, paddock subdivision
- Irrigation distribution to swales
- Livestock water system to paddocks
- Fast-establishing species: poplar, willow, alder, comfrey
- Baseline soil testing

**Years 2-3:** System establishment
- Plant slower species: oaks, chestnuts, fruit trees, shrubs
- Begin rotational grazing with 30+ day rest periods
- Overseed pasture with diverse mix
- Follow-up subsoiling passes
- Annual soil monitoring
- First coppice of willows for biomass
- Begin deep bedding composting and distribution

**Years 5+:** Maturation
- Thin emergent trees (poplar) as permanent canopy develops
- Ongoing rotational grazing and deep bedding composting
- System increasingly self-reinforcing
- Comprehensive soil testing to document outcomes
