# Fogs End Farm: Regenerative Silvopasture Project

**Jackson County, Oregon | 9.5 acres**

---

## The Opportunity

The back five acres of this 9.5-acre property is flood-irrigated pasture with low soil organic matter, poor water-holding capacity, and limited biological activity. The irrigation water arrives every two weeks, but the soil cannot hold it — it runs through and off, underutilized. This project transforms the pasture into an integrated silvopasture system that addresses soil health, water management, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and climate resilience as interconnected outcomes of a single design.

Contour swales capture and infiltrate water, which supports the tree lines. The trees drop organic matter which feeds the pasture, and provide shade and windbreak for animals. Grazing animals cycle nutrients back into the soil, improving water-holding capacity — a regenerative feedback loop.

An eventual goal of this project is to give back to the community by documenting what works (and what doesn't), hosting site visits, and propagating proven genetics for regional distribution.

## The Land

The back 5 acres sits on a gentle north-facing slope, roughly 550 ft (E/W) by 400 ft (N/S). Contours run east-west, with water flowing north and east. An irrigation ditch lines the southern border with a pipe running north to feed the neighboring property. Two barns provide shelter to animals while enabling access to specific paddocks.

## The System

Seven contour swales (~400 ft each) run east-west across the pasture, capturing irrigation water and slowing it for infiltration. Each swale berm carries a diverse tree line — over 30 species selected for drought tolerance, nitrogen fixation, and livestock compatibility. Between the swales, seven paddocks (~0.5 acres each) support rotational grazing: short grazing periods followed by 30+ days of rest, building soil biology through the graze-trample-rest cycle.

Water enters from the south and flows north through the swale system. Each swale captures and holds water, allowing it to infiltrate before any overflow moves to the next level. By the time water reaches the northern edge, it has passed through six opportunities for infiltration.

**Tree line structure (30+ species):**

| Layer | Species | Spacing |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Emergent* | Poplar | 15-20 ft |
| Canopy | Oak, chestnut, honey locust | 40-50 ft |
| Sub-canopy | Pear, persimmon, mulberry, fig | 15-20 ft |
| Shrub | Hazelnut, serviceberry, currant | 8-10 ft |
| Nitrogen-fixers | Alder, Siberian pea shrub, goumi | Interplanted |
| Swale channel | Willow (coppiced for biomass) | 2-3 ft |
| Edges | Sage, lavender, comfrey | Within berm |

*Emergent trees establish quickly to provide shade, then are thinned as the permanent canopy matures (10-15 years).

## What This Addresses

This system addresses five interconnected resource concerns: soil health, water management, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and climate resilience. Soil health improves as organic matter builds through managed grazing, root exudates, and leaf litter from the tree lines — and healthier soil holds more water. Water management shifts from runoff to infiltration, making full use of the existing irrigation allocation. Biodiversity increases through overseeding the pasture and establishing 30+ perennial species in the tree lines, providing habitat for pollinators, beneficial insects, and wildlife. Carbon sequestration happens below ground (grazing stimulates root growth, which pumps carbon into the soil) and above ground (in tree biomass). Climate resilience is the result — deep roots access water during drought, diverse species hedge against variable conditions, and healthier soil buffers both wet and dry extremes.

## Timeline and Outcomes

**Year 1:** Earthwork (swales, access roads), fast-establishing species (poplar, willow, alder, comfrey), fencing, baseline soil testing.

**Years 2-3:** Fill in slower species (oaks, chestnuts, fruit trees), begin rotational grazing, annual soil monitoring.

**Years 5+:** Nurse trees thinned, permanent canopy developing, system increasingly self-reinforcing.

**Expected outcomes:**
- Measurable increase in soil organic matter (baseline established Year 1)
- 30+ plant species established in tree lines
- Improved water retention between irrigation events
- Documented methods and genetics available for regional replication
