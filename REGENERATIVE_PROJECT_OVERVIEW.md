# Fog's End Farm: Regenerative Silvopasture Project

**Jackson County, Oregon | 9.5 acres**

---

## The Opportunity

The back 5 acres of this 9.5-acre property is a flood-irrigated pasture with unrealized potential. Currently, the pasture struggles to hold water and support healthy forage. This project transforms the property into an integrated silvopasture system that addresses soil health, water management, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and climate resilience as interconnected outcomes of a regenerative design.

The system integrates contour swales for water management, diverse tree lines for silvopasture, and rotational grazing for pasture and soil health. The swales capture and infiltrate irrigation water, which supports the tree lines. The trees provide shade and forage for animals while dropping organic matter that feeds the pasture. Rotational grazing invigorates the pasture, builds soil structure, and cycles nutrients back into the soil, which in turn holds more water. Together these components create a regenerative feedback loop.

A long-term goal is to give back to the community by documenting methods and results, hosting site visits, and propagating proven genetics for regional distribution.

## The Land

The back 5 acres sits on a gentle north-facing slope, roughly 550 ft (E/W on contour) by 400 ft (N/S). An irrigation ditch lines the southern border and is the source of flood irrigation. Two barns provide shelter and storage.

The schematic overlay below shows the proposed layout with seven contour swales dividing the pasture into paddocks:

## The System

Seven contour swales (~400 ft each) run east-west across the pasture. Water enters from the south and flows north by gravity, passing through six opportunities for infiltration before leaving the property. Each swale berm carries a diverse tree line with over 20 species selected for drought tolerance, nitrogen fixation, and livestock compatibility. Between the swales, six paddocks (~0.5 acres each) support rotational grazing, with a seventh paddock off-contour on the east side. Short grazing periods, followed by 30+ days of rest, build soil biology through the graze-trample-rest cycle. Poultry follow ruminant grazing, breaking parasite cycles and adding concentrated nutrients. Deep bedding from winter housing is composted and returned to the pasture, feeding soil biology and accelerating organic matter accumulation.

### Tree Line Structure

Each swale berm supports a multi-layer tree line designed for long-term productivity and resilience. Fast-growing emergent trees establish shade and microclimate early, then are thinned as the permanent canopy matures. All species are selected for livestock compatibility, providing a cascade of dropped fruit and nuts from May through February. Pruned foliage provides additional browse.

| Layer | Species | Spacing |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Emergent | Poplar | 30 ft |
| Canopy | Chestnut, honey locust | 40-50 ft |
| Sub-canopy | Mulberry, pear, fig, persimmon, jujube | 15-20 ft |
| Shrub | Serviceberry, hazelnut | 8-10 ft |
| Nitrogen-fixers | Alder, Siberian pea shrub, goumi | Interplanted |
| Swale channel | Willow (coppiced for biomass) | 2-3 ft |
| Edges | Sage, lavender, comfrey, artemisia | 1-2 ft |

### Forage Cascade

Fruit and nut species selected to provide dropped forage from late spring through winter:

| Drop Time | Species | Type |
|-----------|---------|------|
| May-Jun | Mulberry | Fruit |
| Jun | Serviceberry, goumi | Fruit |
| Aug-Sep | Fig, pear | Fruit |
| Sep-Oct | Chestnut, honey locust pods, hazelnut | Nut/Pod |
| Oct-Nov | Persimmon | Fruit |
| Nov-Feb | Jujube | Fruit (dries on tree) |

## Measurable Outcomes

These metrics track progress from baseline conditions toward a productive, resilient system.

| Metric | What It Measures | Baseline (Year 1) | Target (Year 5) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Soil health | Physical, chemical, and biological indicators | Establish baseline | Measurable improvement |
| Surface runoff | How effectively swales capture irrigation | Establish baseline | Full capture |
| Plant species count | Biodiversity across tree lines and pasture | ~5 (grass monoculture) | 20+ perennial species |
| Tree survival rate | Species selection and establishment success | N/A | 80%+ establishment |
| Pasture rest days | Proper grazing rotation | 0 (continuous) | 30+ days between grazing |
| Carrying capacity | Overall pasture productivity | Establish baseline | 25-50% increase |

## Timeline

The project rolls out in three phases, with major infrastructure in Year 1, system establishment in Years 2-3, and maturation ongoing after Year 5.

**Year 1:** Site preparation and infrastructure
- Blackberry removal in lower pasture
- Earthwork: 7 contour swales, access roads, subsoiling
- Fencing: perimeter upgrade, paddock subdivision
- Irrigation distribution to swales
- Livestock water system to paddocks
- Fast-establishing species: poplar, willow, alder, comfrey, sage, lavender
- Baseline soil testing

**Years 2-3:** System establishment
- Plant slower species: chestnuts, fruit trees, shrubs
- Begin rotational grazing with 30+ day rest periods
- Overseed pasture with diverse mix
- Follow-up subsoiling passes
- Annual soil monitoring
- First coppice of willows for biomass
- Begin deep bedding composting and distribution
- Increase stocking rate as pasture productivity allows (target 25% increase)

**Years 5+:** Maturation
- Thin emergent trees (poplar) as permanent canopy develops
- Ongoing rotational grazing and deep bedding composting
- System increasingly self-reinforcing
- Comprehensive soil testing to document outcomes
- Scale stocking rate toward full carrying capacity (target 50%+ increase)

## Estimated Costs

The following estimates cover the full project scope.

| Category | Estimate |
|----------|----------|
| Blackberry removal | $1,500 |
| Earthwork (swales, access roads, subsoiling) | $11,000 - $16,000 |
| Irrigation (distribution + source rehab) | $4,000 - $10,000 |
| Tree/shrub establishment* | $2,000 - $8,000 |
| Fencing (perimeter + paddock, deer deterrent) | $5,000 - $9,000 |
| Livestock water system | $1,200 - $2,200 |
| Soil testing + amendments | $1,000 - $3,500 |
| Pasture seed | $800 - $1,500 |
| Compact tractor (4x4 w/ loader, used) | $8,000 - $15,000 |
| 3-pt broadcast spreader (seed) | $300 - $500 |
| Mobile poultry housing | $1,500 - $3,500 |
| **Total** | **$35,300 - $70,200** |

*Tree/shrub costs vary significantly based on propagation vs. purchasing. Lower end assumes willow, poplar, fig, mulberry, and comfrey propagated from cuttings; higher end assumes mostly bare-root nursery stock.
