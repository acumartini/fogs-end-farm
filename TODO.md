# Fogs End Farm - Project TODO

## NRCS Regenerative Pilot Program Application

### Immediate Actions

- [ ] **Call Jackson County NRCS Office**
  - USDA Service Center - Central Point
  - 89 Alder Street, Central Point, OR 97502
  - Phone: (541) 776-4270
  - Ask about:
    - Next ranking period after January 15, 2026 deadline
    - Starting whole-farm assessment process now
    - Typical timeline from application to approval
    - What documentation they need (deed, tax statement, etc.)
    - **Wetland delineation** for NW wetland and seasonally wet pasture areas
    - Buffer distances required for earthwork near wetland
    - Swampbuster compliance requirements

- [ ] **Obtain property deed**
  - Jackson County Clerk's Office online portal: https://records.jacksoncountyor.gov/
  - Or in person: 10 S Oakdale Ave, Room 113, Medford, OR 97501
  - Phone: (541) 774-6147
  - Alternative: property tax statement showing ownership may suffice

- [ ] **Get farm number from FSA**
  - Required for NRCS financial assistance programs
  - Handled at same USDA Service Center in Central Point
  - Bring: Tax ID (SSN or EIN), deed or proof of ownership

### Application Process

- [ ] Schedule initial consultation with NRCS
- [ ] Request whole-farm assessment
- [ ] Conduct baseline soil testing (establish sampling points)
- [ ] Finalize swale layout with precise contour survey
- [ ] Complete conservation plan with NRCS technical assistance
- [ ] Submit application for next ranking period

### Documentation to Gather

- [ ] Property deed or tax statement
- [ ] Aerial photos of property
- [ ] Existing soil test results (if any)
- [ ] Earthwork quotes for swales ($8-10k obtained)
- [ ] Site photos (current conditions)
- [ ] Topographic/contour information
- [ ] Invasive species inventory (species present, locations, extent)
- [ ] List of water sources available on property

### Resource Concerns to Document (Strengthens Application)

- [ ] **Low soil organic matter** - primary concern; leads to poor water retention
- [ ] **Poor water-holding capacity** - soil drains quickly, doesn't hold moisture
- [ ] **Uncontrolled irrigation runoff** - flood irrigation causing erosion/water loss
- [ ] **Degraded irrigation infrastructure** - aging concrete distribution boxes in poor condition
- [ ] **Invasive species present** - document species, locations, coverage %
- [ ] **Low plant diversity** - monoculture pasture, few species
- [ ] **Poor wildlife habitat** - limited cover, food sources, corridors

### Irrigation Delivery System Redesign

**Source Infrastructure (water entry point, 500' W of garden):**
- [ ] Document and photograph both control boxes at water entry point
- [ ] Document leakage areas and water loss
- [ ] Get quotes for control structure replacement
- [ ] Confirm this area is included in property deed/control

**Distribution System (existing 8" pipe along west edge):**
- [ ] Confirm 8" pipe condition and routing
- [ ] Identify locations for 3 zone gates (feeding swales 1, 3, 5)
- [ ] Purchase: 3 slide gates @ $100 each = $300
- [ ] Purchase: 5 HDPE riser overflow assemblies @ ~$40 each = $200
- [ ] Design swale inlet from gate to swale (T-fitting? open riser?)

**Overflow System (HDPE risers):**
- [ ] Determine overflow height for each swale (sets riser cut height)
- [ ] Parts list per overflow: 6" HDPE riser (2-3 ft) + 90° elbow + horizontal section (4-8 ft)
- [ ] Plan riser locations in each swale berm

**Design Questions to Resolve:**
- [ ] What swale dimensions provide adequate water retention?
- [ ] How long does each swale need to hold water for adequate seepage?
- [ ] Will passive seepage + overflow adequately water the 50' paddock below?
- [ ] Test in Year 1, adjust design if needed

## Project Implementation (Can Proceed Independent of NRCS)

### Earthwork / Swales

- [ ] Finalize contour survey (confirm E/W swale lines)
- [ ] Schedule earthwork contractor
- [ ] Complete 7-8 swale installation
- [ ] Seed swale channels and berms immediately after earthwork

### Tree Establishment

- [ ] Develop species list for tree lines
- [ ] Source trees (bare root, nursery propagation, etc.)
- [ ] Plant during appropriate window (late winter/early spring for bare root)
- [ ] Install heavy mulch on tree lines
- [ ] Set up irrigation for tree establishment if needed

### Fencing / Infrastructure

- [ ] Plan paddock subdivision layout
- [ ] Install perimeter fencing upgrades
- [ ] Install electric fence for tree line protection
- [ ] Set up livestock water system to paddocks

### Grazing System

- [ ] Determine initial livestock species/numbers
- [ ] Acquire livestock
- [ ] Begin adaptive multi-paddock rotation (Year 2)

| Contact | Phone | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| NRCS Central Point | (541) 776-4270 | Conservation programs, whole-farm assessment |
| Jackson County Clerk | (541) 774-6147 | Property deed records |
| Regenerative Pilot Program | regenerative@usda.gov | Program-specific questions |

## Important Dates

| Date | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| January 15, 2026 | National batching deadline (FY2026) | MISSED |
| TBD | Next ranking period | Ask NRCS |
| Spring 2026 | Ideal earthwork window | Planning |
| Late Winter 2026 | Bare root tree planting window | Planning |

---

### Demonstration / Education Commitment

- [ ] Establish fixed photo points for quarterly documentation
- [ ] Set up data collection system (soil tests, forage, observations)
- [ ] Confirm willingness to host site visits / field days
- [ ] Consent to NRCS use of data/photos in educational materials

---

## Notes

- Missed Jan 15 deadline, but applications accepted year-round
- Apply now to be queued for next ranking period
- Starting assessment process early = stronger application
- Swale/tree work can proceed on own timeline; may be retroactively eligible or covered in future contract

### Primary Practices in Proposal (from approved list)
1. Grazing Management (528)
2. Contour Farming / Water Harvesting (330, 636)
3. Cover Crop (340)
4. Nutrient Management (590)
5. Forage Harvest Management (511)
6. Pest Management Conservation System (595)
7. Irrigation Water Management (449)

### Key Proposal Strengths
- Addresses multiple documented resource concerns (organic matter, water, invasives, biodiversity)
- Bundled practices as single integrated system (what pilot program emphasizes)
- Water harvesting earthworks solve real runoff problem
- Education/demonstration commitment adds value beyond individual farm
- Small-scale model applicable to many similar properties
