# Fogs End Farm - Project TODO

## NRCS Regenerative Pilot Program Application

### Immediate Actions

- [ ] **Email Peter Winnick at NRCS** (see email draft below)
  - peter.winnick@usda.gov
  - USDA Service Center - Central Point
  - 89 Alder Street, Central Point, OR 97502
  - Phone: (541) 423-6157
  - Ask about:
    - Next ranking period after January 15, 2026 deadline
    - Starting whole-farm assessment process now
    - Typical timeline from application to approval
    - What documentation they need (deed, tax statement, etc.)
    - **Wetland delineation** for NW wetland and seasonally wet pasture areas
    - Buffer distances required for earthwork near wetland
    - Swampbuster compliance requirements

- [ ] **Obtain property deed**
  - Jackson County Clerk's Office online portal: https://records.jacksoncountyor.gov/
  - Or in person: 10 S Oakdale Ave, Room 113, Medford, OR 97501
  - Phone: (541) 774-6147
  - Alternative: property tax statement showing ownership may suffice

- [ ] **Get farm number from FSA**
  - Required for NRCS financial assistance programs
  - Handled at same USDA Service Center in Central Point
  - Bring: Tax ID (SSN or EIN), deed or proof of ownership

- [ ] **Confirm beginning farmer status with FSA**
  - CRITICAL: Qualifies for 90% cost-share (vs 75% standard)
  - Reduces producer contribution from $7,000-$13,000 to $2,800-$5,300
  - Criteria: Has not operated a farm/ranch for more than 10 years
  - No farm number yet = strong indicator of beginning farmer status
  - Ask FSA to document beginning farmer determination when getting farm number

### Application Process

- [ ] Schedule initial consultation with NRCS
- [ ] Request whole-farm assessment
- [ ] Conduct baseline soil testing (establish sampling points)
- [ ] Finalize swale layout with precise contour survey
- [ ] Complete conservation plan with NRCS technical assistance
- [ ] Submit application for next ranking period

### Documentation to Gather

- [ ] Property deed or tax statement
- [ ] Aerial photos of property
- [ ] Existing soil test results (if any)
- [ ] Earthwork quotes for swales + access road ($12-15k revised estimate - get updated quote)
- [ ] Site photos (current conditions)
- [ ] Topographic/contour information
- [ ] Invasive species inventory (species present, locations, extent)
- [ ] List of water sources available on property

### Resource Concerns to Document (Strengthens Application)

- [ ] **Low soil organic matter** - primary concern; leads to poor water retention
- [ ] **Poor water-holding capacity** - soil drains quickly, doesn't hold moisture
- [ ] **Uncontrolled irrigation runoff** - flood irrigation causing erosion/water loss
- [ ] **Degraded irrigation infrastructure** - aging concrete distribution boxes in poor condition
- [ ] **Invasive species present** - document species, locations, coverage %
- [ ] **Low plant diversity** - monoculture pasture, few species
- [ ] **Poor wildlife habitat** - limited cover, food sources, corridors

### Irrigation Delivery System Redesign

**Source Infrastructure (water entry point, 500' W of garden):**
- [ ] Document and photograph both control boxes at water entry point
- [ ] Document leakage areas and water loss
- [ ] Get quotes for control structure replacement
- [ ] Confirm this area is included in property deed/control

**Distribution System (existing 8" pipe along west edge):**
- [ ] Confirm 8" pipe condition and routing
- [ ] Identify locations for 3 zone gates (Gate 1→Swale 1, Gate 2→Swale 3, Gate 3→Swale 5)
- [ ] Purchase: 3 slide gates @ $100 each = $300 (Gate 1→Swale 1, Gate 2→Swale 3, Gate 3→Swale 5)
- [ ] Purchase: 7 HDPE riser overflow assemblies @ ~$40 each = $280
- [ ] Design swale inlet from gate to swale (T-fitting? open riser?)

**Overflow System (HDPE risers):**
- [ ] Determine overflow height for each swale (sets riser cut height)
- [ ] Parts list per overflow: 6" HDPE riser (2-3 ft) + 90° elbow + horizontal section (4-8 ft)
- [ ] Plan riser locations in each swale berm

**Design Questions to Resolve:**
- [ ] What swale dimensions provide adequate water retention?
- [ ] How long does each swale need to hold water for adequate seepage?
- [ ] Will passive seepage + overflow adequately water the 50' paddock below?
- [ ] Test in Year 1, adjust design if needed

---

## Project Implementation (Can Proceed Independent of NRCS)

### Earthwork / Swales

- [ ] Finalize contour survey (confirm E/W swale lines)
- [ ] Schedule earthwork contractor
- [ ] Complete 7-8 swale installation
- [ ] Seed swale channels and berms immediately after earthwork

### Tree/Plant Establishment

**Species list complete** - see "Tree/Shrub Species Selection" section below

- [ ] Source willow cuttings (local willows or purchase mother plants)
- [ ] Source poplar cuttings (local or nursery)
- [ ] Order bare root trees: oaks, chestnuts, persimmon, hazelnut, serviceberry, black locust
- [ ] Order/propagate: mulberry, fig (cuttings)
- [ ] Source comfrey root divisions (Bocking 14)
- [ ] Source aromatic starts or seed: sage, lavender, wormwood
- [ ] Plan propagation area for Year 1 cuttings
- [ ] Plant during appropriate window:
  - Late winter: hardwood cuttings (willow, poplar, fig)
  - Late winter/early spring: bare root trees
  - Spring: aromatics, comfrey
- [ ] Install heavy mulch on tree lines (12"+ around trees)
- [ ] Elderberry in wetland buffer only (toxic to livestock)

### Fencing / Infrastructure

- [ ] Plan paddock subdivision layout
- [ ] Install perimeter fencing upgrades
- [ ] Install electric fence for tree line protection
- [ ] Set up livestock water system to paddocks

### Grazing System

- [ ] Identify grazing partner (local livestock owner willing to graze animals on property)
  - Landowner provides: pasture, water, fencing, rotational management
  - Animal owner provides: livestock, veterinary care, animal husbandry expertise
- [ ] Determine initial livestock species/numbers with partner
- [ ] Begin adaptive multi-paddock rotation (Year 2)
- [ ] Plan poultry integration (following ruminants)
  - Mobile chicken tractor or electronet for rotation
  - Timing: 3-4 days behind ruminants for parasite/pest control
  - Adds fertility and breaks pest cycles

### Mobile Poultry Infrastructure (Confirm EQIP Eligibility)

- [ ] **Confirm eligibility with NRCS** - Ask if the following qualify under integrated pest management:
  - Electronet poultry fencing (~$350-500 for 164 ft sections, need 2-3)
  - Mobile shelter/chicken tractor (~$300-800 depending on size/construction)
  - Frame as: "Poultry following ruminants for parasite control and nutrient cycling"
  - Relevant practice codes to ask about: 382 (Fence), 472 (Livestock Shelter), 595 (Pest Management)

## Initial Email to NRCS

**To:** peter.winnick@usda.gov  
**Subject:** Regenerative Pilot Program Inquiry - 9.5-acre Silvopasture Project, Jackson County

---

Hi Peter,

I'm writing to inquire about the new NRCS Regenerative Pilot Program for my 9.5-acre property in Jackson County. I have approximately 5 acres of pasture that I'd like to convert to an integrated silvopasture system, and the program's emphasis on bundled, whole-farm regenerative practices seems like an excellent fit.

**The Project:**

The property currently has underutilized pasture with flood irrigation (2.5 days every two weeks via irrigation district). My plan is to install 7 contour swales running east-west across the pasture (5 standard swales plus 2 access roads - one on the south edge near the barns, one on the north edge before the wetland), with diverse tree lines on the berms, creating 6 paddocks for managed rotational grazing. The paddocks will be split E/W to create 12 grazing cells for adequate rest periods. The northern access road/swale will be densely planted with willow and poplar to capture any remaining runoff nutrients as biomass before overflow reaches the wetland. The swales would capture and infiltrate irrigation runoff that currently runs off unused, while the tree lines would add nitrogen fixation, shade, biomass, and biodiversity to what is now a simple grass pasture.

I also have aging irrigation infrastructure at the water entry point (two old concrete control boxes that leak significantly) that needs rehabilitation.

**Resource Concerns the Project Addresses:**
- Low soil organic matter and poor water-holding capacity
- Uncontrolled irrigation runoff
- Low plant diversity and limited wildlife habitat
- Degraded irrigation infrastructure

**Why I'm Reaching Out Now:**

I know I missed the January 15 national deadline, but I understand applications are accepted year-round for subsequent ranking periods. I'd like to start the assessment and planning process now so I'm well-prepared for the next deadline.

**Questions:**

1. When is the next ranking period, and what timeline should I plan for?
2. How do I schedule a whole-farm assessment?
3. I have a small wetland (~0.25 acres) in the NW corner of the property. What's the process for wetland delineation and determining buffer requirements for earthwork?
4. Do I need to obtain a farm number from FSA before working with NRCS, or can that happen in parallel?

I've drafted a detailed project proposal and would be happy to share it if helpful. I'm also available for a site visit at your convenience.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

[Your name]  
[Phone]  
[Property address]

## Tree/Shrub Species Selection - Swale Tree Lines

### Design Context

**Location:** 5-6 tree lines on contour swale berms, running E/W across pasture
**Row length:** ~400 feet each (centered in paddock area, with 50 ft access corridors on E and W ends for livestock movement to barns)
**Climate:** Jackson County, OR (USDA Zone 7b-8a, hot dry summers, wet winters)
**Water:** Flood irrigation every 2 weeks (2.5 days), swale water harvesting
**Goals:** Nitrogen fixation, biomass production, shade, biodiversity, eventual fodder/browse

### Key Constraints

1. **No drip irrigation** - trees must establish with flood irrigation + swale water
2. **Deer pressure** - need protection or deer-resistant species in early years
3. **Summer drought** - 2-4 months of dry conditions between rain seasons
4. **Eventual grazing integration** - trees must tolerate some browse when mature

### Species Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Priority | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Drought tolerance (once established) | HIGH | Critical for this system |
| Flood tolerance (periodic inundation) | HIGH | Swales will hold water |
| Fast establishment | HIGH | Reduces vulnerable period |
| Nitrogen fixation | HIGH | Fertility for pasture |
| **Livestock safety** | HIGH | Must be non-toxic for eventual grazing integration |
| Deep rooting | MEDIUM | Access stored swale water |
| Deer resistance | MEDIUM | Or plan for protection |
| Browse tolerance | MEDIUM | For future grazing integration |
| Biomass production | MEDIUM | Chop-and-drop mulch |
| Wildlife value | MEDIUM | Pollinator/bird habitat |
| Edible/marketable products | LOW | Secondary to system function |

### Livestock Safety Notes

**Species to AVOID in grazed tree lines:**
| Species | Toxic Parts | Risk Level | Notes |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Elderberry** | Leaves, stems, bark, unripe berries | Moderate-High | Cyanogenic glycosides; plant in wetland buffer only |
| **Black Walnut** | Leaves, nuts, roots (juglone) | High for horses | Horses very sensitive; cattle/sheep less affected |
| **Yew** | All parts | DEADLY | Never plant in livestock areas |
| **Cherry/Plum** (wild) | Wilted leaves | High | Cyanide in wilted leaves; fresh or dry is safer |
| **Red Maple** | Wilted leaves | High for horses | Causes hemolytic anemia in horses |

**Safe species for silvopasture (all species in this plan unless noted):**
- All oaks (acorns in moderation)
- Mulberry, persimmon, fig, pear, apple
- Black locust (pods are fodder; leaves less palatable but not highly toxic)
- Honey locust (excellent fodder)
- Alder, willow
- Hazelnut, serviceberry
- All nitrogen-fixers listed except autumn olive (invasive concern, not toxicity)

### Recommended Species by Layer

#### Emergent/Nurse Trees (30-40 ft spacing)
Fast initial shade while long-term canopy establishes; coppice or remove as oaks/chestnuts mature

| Species | N-fix | Drought | Flood | Deer | Livestock Safe | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| **Hybrid Poplar** (*Populus* hybrids) | No | Moderate | Excellent | Moderate | YES | 6-10 ft/year, coppice, 30-50 yr lifespan, easy from cuttings |
| **Black Cottonwood** (*Populus trichocarpa*) | No | Moderate | Excellent | Moderate | YES | Native PNW, large, fast |

**Recommendation:** Plant poplar at 30-40 ft spacing in Year 1 for fast shade. Coppice for biomass or remove as permanent canopy matures (10-15 years).

#### Canopy Trees (40-50 ft spacing)
Long-term shade, carbon sequestration, structure - these are the permanent anchors

| Species | N-fix | Drought | Flood | Deer | Livestock Safe | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| **Oregon White Oak** (*Quercus garryana*) | No | Excellent | Moderate | Good | YES | Native, long-lived, wildlife, slow establishment |
| **Valley Oak** (*Quercus lobata*) | No | Excellent | Good | Good | YES | Similar to above, faster growth |
| **Chestnut** (*Castanea sativa* or hybrids) | No | Good | Moderate | Moderate | YES | Nuts, faster than oak, blight-resistant hybrids available |
| **Honey Locust** (*Gleditsia triacanthos*) | Indirect | Excellent | Good | Good | YES | Pods for fodder, dappled shade, thornless varieties |

**Recommendation:** 2-3 oaks + 1-2 chestnuts per tree line, with honey locust for faster mid-term shade and fodder

**REMOVED from consideration:**
- ~~Black Walnut~~ - toxic to horses (juglone)
- ~~Cherry~~ - wilted leaves contain cyanide, dangerous in silvopasture

#### Sub-Canopy Trees (15-20 ft spacing)
Fruit, wildlife, partial shade

| Species | N-fix | Drought | Flood | Deer | Livestock Safe | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| **Mulberry** (*Morus* spp.) | No | Excellent | Good | Moderate | YES | Fast, fruit for wildlife/poultry, tolerates browse |
| **Persimmon** (*Diospyros* spp.) | No | Excellent | Good | Good | YES | Fruit, deep rooted, American or Asian varieties |
| **Fig** (*Ficus carica*) | No | Excellent | Moderate | Good | YES | Fruit, browse tolerant when established |
| **Serviceberry** (*Amelanchier* spp.) | No | Good | Good | Moderate | YES | Native, fruit, wildlife, wet tolerant |
| **Pear** (rootstock dependent) | No | Good | Moderate | Poor | YES | Fruit, needs deer protection early |
| **Apple** (rootstock dependent) | No | Moderate | Moderate | Poor | YES | Fruit, needs deer protection, more irrigation |
| ~~Elderberry~~ (*Sambucus* spp.) | No | Good | Excellent | Moderate | **CAUTION** | **WETLAND BUFFER ONLY** - toxic leaves/stems to livestock |

**Recommendation:** Mulberry and persimmon (throughout swale tree lines), serviceberry (wet-tolerant alternative to elderberry)

**ELDERBERRY NOTE:** Plant elderberry ONLY in wetland buffer zone where livestock will never access. Leaves, stems, and unripe berries contain cyanogenic glycosides (toxic to cattle, sheep, horses). Do not place in swale tree lines that will eventually be integrated with grazing.

#### Nitrogen-Fixing Trees/Shrubs (10-15 ft spacing)
Critical for fertility, fast establishment, biomass

| Species | N-fix | Drought | Flood | Deer | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|------|-------|
| **Black Locust** (*Robinia pseudoacacia*) | YES | Excellent | Moderate | Good | Fast, coppice, posts/firewood, thorny, can spread |
| **Honey Locust** (*Gleditsia*) | Indirect | Excellent | Good | Good | Not true N-fixer but soil improver |
| **Autumn Olive** (*Elaeagnus umbellata*) | YES | Excellent | Moderate | Good | Aggressive spreader - may not want |

| **Tagasaste/Tree Lucerne** (*Cytisus proliferus*) | YES | Excellent | Poor | Moderate | Mediterranean, fodder, may not tolerate flooding |

**Recommendation:** 
- Black locust (main N-fixer, coppice for biomass/posts) - thornless varieties if available
- Alder (wet areas near swales)
- Goumi or Siberian pea shrub (shrub layer, lower risk than autumn olive)

#### Shrub Layer (8-10 ft spacing)
Diversity, wildlife, understory

| Species | N-fix | Drought | Flood | Deer | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|------|-------|

**Placement logic:**
- **Aromatics (uphill/south edge of berm):** Drought-tolerant, won't get flooded, deer-resistant
- **Main trees (berm top):** Well-drained, protected from flooding
- **Willow (swale channel, north of berm):** Tolerates periodic flooding, coppice for biomass

### Planting Strategy by Year

**Year 1 (Establishment Priority):**
Focus on fast-establishing species for quick shade and system function

- **Poplar** (cuttings or bare root) - emergent nurse trees, fast shade
- Black locust (bare root, winter planting) - N-fixer, biomass
- Mulberry (bare root) - fast, fruit
- Siberian pea shrub (bare root) - N-fixer shrub layer
- Serviceberry (bare root) - wet-tolerant sub-canopy
- Comfrey (root cuttings around all trees)
- Elderberry (WETLAND BUFFER ONLY - bare root or cuttings)

**Year 2 (Fill-in):**
Add slower species once irrigation/swale system is proven

- Oaks (container or bare root, need protection) - long-term canopy
- Chestnut (bare root or container) - long-term canopy, nuts
- Persimmon (bare root)
- Hazelnut (bare root)
- Goumi (container)

**Year 3+ (Long-term):**
Add less drought-tolerant species in proven wet spots

- Fruit trees (figs, pears where successful)
- Native shrubs (Oregon grape)
- Additional canopy trees for final spacing
- Honey locust (where fodder/shade needed)

**Years 10-15 (Canopy Transition):**
As oaks and chestnuts mature, coppice or remove poplars to open canopy. Poplar wood useful for firewood, mulch, or leave as standing deadwood for wildlife.

### Sourcing Strategy

| Source Type | Species | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|---------|------|------|
| **Bare root (nurseries)** | Most deciduous trees | Cheap, establishes well, winter planting | Narrow planting window |
| **On-site propagation** | Willow, poplar, comfrey, fig (elderberry for wetland only) | Free, local genetics | Time to produce |
| **Native plant sales** | Oregon white oak, serviceberry, Oregon grape | Adapted, often cheap | Limited selection/timing |
| **Container stock** | Slow to establish species | Plant anytime, reliable | More expensive, rootbound risk |
| **Seed** | Oak, chestnut, locust | Cheapest, best taproot | Very slow, rodent predation |
| **Cuttings** | Poplar, willow, mulberry, fig | Free/cheap, easy | Timing matters, need moisture |

### Deer Protection Options

Since many species are deer-vulnerable when young:

1. **Individual tree cages** - wire mesh cylinders (4-5 ft tall)
2. **Electric fence along tree line** - already planned for livestock exclusion
3. **Tree tubes** - plastic tubes, good for oaks
4. **Deer-resistant first** - establish locust, aromatic herbs (sage, lavender), then add vulnerable species inside protection

### Quantities Estimate (Dense-to-Thin Strategy)

For 7 tree lines x 400 ft each = 2,800 linear feet of tree line
(5 full tree lines on swale berms + 2 on access roads - Swale 1 S and Swale 7 N)

**Strategy:** Plant support species (poplars, N-fixers, aromatics) at higher initial density, then thin/coppice as permanent canopy matures. This accelerates establishment, front-loads nitrogen, and provides insurance against losses.

| Layer | Initial Spacing | Long-term Spacing | Initial Count | Species | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Emergent/Nurse | 15-20 ft | Remove as canopy matures | ~160 trees | Poplar | Fast shade; coppice/remove years 8-15 |
| Canopy (permanent) | 45 ft | 45 ft | ~63 trees | Oak, chestnut, honey locust | Long-term anchors; don't thin |
| Sub-canopy | 17 ft | 17 ft | ~165 trees | Mulberry, persimmon, serviceberry, fig, hazelnut | Permanent; fruit, wildlife, nuts |
| N-fixers | 5-8 ft | 15-20 ft (thin) | ~400-560 | Black locust, alder, goumi, Siberian pea | Dense initial; thin/coppice years 4-7 |
| Wet edge (willow) | 2-3 ft | 2-3 ft (maintain dense) | ~935-1,400 | Willow | Dense coppice; maintain permanently |
| Dry edge (aromatic) | 2 ft | Thin as needed | ~1,400 | Sage, lavender, wormwood | Dense initial; thin to 3 ft as mature |
| Herbaceous | Throughout | Throughout | 450+ | Comfrey, clover seed | Permanent understory |

**Initial totals (dense planting):**
- **Berm trees/shrubs:** ~790-950 (poplars, canopy, sub-canopy, N-fixers)
- **Edge plantings:** ~2,335-2,800 (dense willow + aromatics)
- **Herbaceous:** 450+ (comfrey, clover)

**Long-term totals (after thinning):**
- **Berm trees/shrubs:** ~400-480 (permanent canopy, sub-canopy, retained N-fixers)
- **Edge plantings:** ~1,750-2,200 (willow maintained, aromatics thinned)

**Management timeline:**
- Years 1-3: All species establish; support species provide shade/fertility
- Years 4-7: Begin thinning N-fixers; coppice willows and black locust for biomass
- Years 8-15: Remove/heavy coppice poplars as oaks/chestnuts reach functional size

**Willow note:** Dense spacing maintained permanently for maximum biomass. Coppice on 2-3 year rotation. All propagated from cuttings = essentially free. Source initial cutting wood from existing willows in area or purchase a few mother plants first year.

**Free/cheap propagation opportunities:**
| Species | Method | Cost |
|---------|--------|------|
| Poplar | Hardwood cuttings | Free |
| Willow | Hardwood cuttings | Free |
| Fig | Cuttings | Free |
| Comfrey | Root divisions | Free |
| Sage/Lavender | Cuttings or seed | Low |

**Cost estimate:**
| Approach | Est. Cost |
|----------|-----------|
| All purchased | $8,000 - $15,000 |
| Heavy propagation (poplar, willow, fig, comfrey, aromatics) | $3,000 - $5,000 |
| Max propagation + native plant sales + seed | **$2,000 - $3,500** |

**Recommended approach:** Propagate poplars, willows, figs, comfrey, aromatics on-site. Buy oaks, chestnuts, fruit trees (persimmon, hazelnut), and specialty species.
