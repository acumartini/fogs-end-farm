# NRCS Regenerative Pilot Program Proposal

## Fogs End Farm - Small-Scale Regenerative Model Farm

**Total Property Size:** 9.5 acres  
**Active Production Area:** 6 acres (back portion of property)  
**Primary Land Use:** Pasture (4.5 ac), No-Till Garden, Nursery, Wetland (0.25 ac), Irrigation Infrastructure (1 ac)  
**Program:** NRCS Regenerative Pilot Program (FY2026)  
**Funding Source:** EQIP ($400M pool) and/or CSP ($300M pool)

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal presents a comprehensive whole-farm regenerative plan for a 5-acre production area featuring an integrated silvopasture system with contour swales, diverse tree lines, and managed grazing paddocks. The design directly addresses a critical water management challenge: controlling runoff from existing flood-style irrigation through earthworks that capture, slow, and infiltrate water while creating productive agroforestry zones.

The project integrates:
- **Contour swale system** (5-6 swales running E/W) for irrigation runoff management
- **Diverse tree lines** on swale berms for biomass, shade, biodiversity, and soil biology
- **6 grazing paddocks** between swales with adaptive multi-paddock management
- **Wetland buffer zone** (0.25 ac, NW corner) for wildlife habitat and water quality
- **No-till garden and nursery** integrated into the whole-farm system
- **Irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation** (1 ac) - replacement of degraded concrete distribution boxes to improve water efficiency at the source

This proposal prioritizes the regenerative system itself as a replicable model for small-scale integrated silvopasture, with production as a secondary outcome of healthy land function.

---

## Part 2: Whole-Farm Assessment Framework

### 2.1 Resource Concern Categories

The whole-farm assessment will address all NRCS resource concern categories:

#### Soil Resource Concerns
- **Soil Organic Matter Depletion (PRIMARY CONCERN):** Current pasture has low organic matter content resulting in poor water-holding capacity. Baseline testing will establish starting levels; target 1% increase over contract period. Every component of this system addresses organic matter building.
- **Water-Holding Capacity:** Directly linked to organic matter - soil currently drains quickly and does not retain moisture between irrigation events. Improved through organic matter building, living roots, and swale water harvesting.
- **Aggregate Stability:** Measured through soil health testing; improved via root systems and fungal networks from diverse plantings
- **Soil Biology:** Baseline biological activity assessment; enhanced through diverse plantings, reduced disturbance, and increased organic inputs from tree lines and managed grazing

#### Water Resource Concerns
- **Surface Water Quality:** Runoff management through vegetated buffers and improved infiltration
- **Groundwater Quality:** Nutrient management to prevent leaching
- **Water Quantity/Efficiency:** Improved water holding capacity through increased organic matter
- **Drainage/Infiltration:** Enhanced through soil structure improvements and cover systems

#### Natural Vitality (Biodiversity) Concerns
- **Habitat Diversity:** Multi-species pasture system supporting pollinators, beneficial insects, and wildlife
- **Plant Community Health:** Diverse perennial and annual species integration
- **Ecosystem Function:** Carbon cycling, nutrient cycling, and water cycling as integrated system

### 2.2 Site Characterization

#### Property Layout
- **Total Property:** 9.5 acres
- **Active Production Area:** Back 5 acres (focus of this proposal)
- **Dimensions:** 550 ft (E/W) x 400 ft (N/S)
- **Contour Orientation:** Runs approximately E/W

#### Existing Infrastructure
- **SW Barn:** Running water, hay storage, equipment
- **SE Barn:** Running water, hay storage
- **Access Road:** South side of pasture (shared with irrigation infrastructure)
- **Irrigation System:** Flood-style irrigation along south access corridor

#### Water Features
- **Wetland:** NW corner, approximately 0.25 acres (requires delineation and buffer determination)
- **Seasonally Wet Areas:** Some pasture areas hold water longer than others; require assessment to determine if jurisdictional wetlands or simply poorly drained soils
- **Irrigation Runoff:** Significant water management challenge from flood irrigation currently causing uncontrolled runoff across pasture

#### Wetland Delineation Required
NRCS wetland delineation requested to:
- Confirm boundaries of NW wetland
- Determine if seasonally wet pasture areas qualify as wetlands
- Establish appropriate buffer distances for earthwork
- Ensure Swampbuster compliance

#### Current Land Use
- **Pasture:** ~4.5 acres (continuous, to be subdivided)
- **No-Till Garden:** Located within production area
- **Nursery:** Located within production area
- **Wetland Buffer:** NW corner

#### Data to Gather with NRCS
- [ ] Soil survey data and soil types present
- [ ] Precise slope percentages for swale design
- [ ] Wetland delineation and buffer requirements
- [ ] Climate data and precipitation patterns
- [ ] Historical land use and management

## Part 3: Primary Regenerative Practices

Based on the approved practice list and the specific site conditions (flood irrigation runoff, pasture subdivision needs, biodiversity goals), the following **bundled primary practices** form the core of this regenerative plan:

### 3.1 Grazing Management (Practice 528) - PRIMARY

**Rationale:** The cornerstone practice for pasture-based regenerative systems. Properly managed grazing is the most powerful tool for building soil health, cycling nutrients, and stimulating plant growth on pastureland.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Adaptive Multi-Paddock (AMP) Grazing System:** 6-7 paddocks created between contour swales
- **Paddock Size:** Approximately 0.5-0.65 acres each (based on ~50 ft spacing between swales)
- **High Stock Density, Short Duration:** Animals concentrated for brief periods (1-3 days) followed by extended rest (30-90+ days depending on season)
- **Rest Period Management:** Recovery time based on plant growth stage, not calendar dates
- **Tree Line Exclusion:** Portable electric wire keeps animals out of swale tree lines, protecting young trees while allowing biomass to accumulate
- **Animal Impact as Tool:** Targeted trampling to incorporate residue, break soil caps, and stimulate biological activity

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Increased pasture productivity (forage dry matter per acre)
- Improved plant diversity and desirable species composition
- Reduced bare ground percentage
- Enhanced root depth and density

### 3.2 Contour Buffer Strips / Tree Establishment - PRIMARY (Multiple Practice Codes)

**Rationale:** The defining feature of this system. Contour swales address a critical existing resource concern: uncontrolled flood irrigation runoff currently causing erosion and water loss across the pasture. This water harvesting earthwork system will capture, slow, spread, and infiltrate runoff - keeping water on the landscape rather than losing it. The swale berms create productive silvopasture zones, directly addressing both soil AND water resource concerns simultaneously.

**Conservation Benefits of Earthwork:**
- **Eliminates uncontrolled runoff** from flood irrigation system
- **Increases water infiltration** and groundwater recharge
- **Reduces erosion** from current sheet flow across pasture
- **Extends water availability** for pastures and trees between irrigation events
- **Protects downstream wetland** by slowing and filtering water before arrival

**Relevant NRCS Practices:**
- **Contour Farming (330)** - Swale orientation follows contour
- **Hedgerow Planting (422)** - Diverse tree/shrub rows on swale berms
- **Riparian Herbaceous Cover (390)** - Vegetated swale channels
- **Tree/Shrub Establishment (612)** - Multi-species tree lines
- **Silvopasture (381)** - Integration of trees with grazing system
- **Grade Stabilization Structure (410)** - If swales include overflow management
- **Water Harvesting Catchment (636)** - Capturing runoff for beneficial use

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Earthwork:** 7-8 water harvesting swales on contour, running E/W across the 400 ft N/S dimension
- **Swale location:** Away from NW wetland, respecting buffer distances determined by NRCS wetland delineation
- **Spacing:** Approximately 50 ft between swales
- **Swale Function:** Capture, slow, spread, and infiltrate irrigation runoff
- **Tree Line Planting:** Diverse species on swale berms (downhill side)
- **Species Selection Goals:**
  - Nitrogen-fixing trees (black locust, alder, autumn olive)
  - Biomass/mulch production (willow, poplar)
  - Shade canopy development (oak, walnut, fruit/nut trees)
  - Wildlife/pollinator habitat (native flowering species)
  - Soil biology enhancement (mycorrhizal host species)

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Elimination of uncontrolled irrigation runoff
- Increased water infiltration and groundwater recharge
- Tree survival and growth rates
- Canopy cover percentage over time
- Biomass production from tree line prunings

**Estimated Cost:** $8,000-$10,000 for earthwork (quotes obtained)

### 3.3 Cover Crop (Practice 340) - PRIMARY

**Rationale:** Cover crops extend living root presence, fix atmospheric nitrogen, improve soil biology, and prevent erosion during vulnerable periods.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Pasture Overseeding:** Introduce diverse species into existing pasture sward
- **Multi-Species Mixes:** Combine grasses, legumes, and forbs for functional diversity
  - **Grasses:** Annual ryegrass, cereal rye, oats (seasonal nurse crops)
  - **Legumes:** Crimson clover, hairy vetch, winter peas (nitrogen fixation)
  - **Forbs/Brassicas:** Daikon radish, turnips, chicory (deep rooting, soil structure)
- **Seasonal Strategy:** Cool-season covers for fall/winter/spring; warm-season annuals if needed for summer gaps
- **Integration with Grazing:** Covers grazed as part of rotation, maximizing nutrient cycling

**Seeding Methods (low-tech, appropriate scale):**
- **Tow-behind broadcast spreader:** Pulled by zero-turn mower for efficient coverage
- **Drag harrow:** Light chain or harrow drag to scratch seed into soil surface
- **Animal trampling:** Move livestock through seeded area to press seed into soil
- **Frost seeding:** Broadcast on frozen ground in late winter; freeze-thaw cycles work seed in
- **Post-grazing overseed:** Seed immediately after grazing when residue is short and soil exposed

Equipment needs are minimal - tow-behind spreader and light drag harrow suitable for zero-turn mower (~$300-600 total, confirm eligibility with NRCS).

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Year-round living root presence
- Increased nitrogen availability from legume fixation
- Improved water infiltration rates
- Enhanced pollinator and beneficial insect habitat

### 3.4 Nutrient Management (Practice 590) - PRIMARY

**Rationale:** Proper nutrient cycling is essential for regenerative systems. The goal is to transition from external inputs to closed-loop nutrient cycling through biological processes.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Soil Testing Protocol:** Comprehensive baseline testing including standard fertility, organic matter, and biological indicators
- **Nutrient Budget Development:** Calculate inputs (nitrogen fixation, atmospheric deposition, any amendments) and outputs (harvest removal, animal products)
- **Animal-Driven Cycling:** Grazing management distributes manure and urine across paddocks
- **Amendment Strategy (if needed):** Targeted applications based on soil test results, prioritizing biological and mineral amendments over synthetic inputs
- **Legume Integration:** Nitrogen fixation as primary nitrogen source

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Stable or improving soil nutrient levels without synthetic fertilizer dependency
- Improved nutrient use efficiency
- Reduced potential for nutrient runoff or leaching

### 3.5 Forage Harvest Management (Practice 511) - SUPPORTING PRIMARY

**Rationale:** For pasture systems, how and when forage is harvested (grazed or mechanically) directly impacts plant health, regrowth, and soil carbon inputs.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Grazing Height Management:** "Take half, leave half" principle - never graze below optimal residual height
- **Recovery Before Regrazing:** Plants must fully recover root reserves before next grazing event
- **Seasonal Adjustments:** Longer rest periods during slow growth; may include hay harvest in peak growth
- **Stockpiling:** Accumulate fall growth for extended grazing season

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Maintained plant vigor and stand persistence
- Maximized root:shoot ratio and carbon sequestration
- Extended grazing season reducing hay dependency

---

## Part 4: Supporting Practices

The following practices support the primary regenerative management system:

### 4.1 Wetland Wildlife Habitat Management (Practice 644)

**Location:** NW corner, approximately 0.25 acres

**Rationale:** The existing wetland is a significant ecological asset. Proper management enhances wildlife habitat, water quality, and biodiversity while integrating with the overall farm system.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Maintain appropriate buffer from grazing activity
- Enhance native wetland vegetation
- Create wildlife corridor connecting wetland to tree lines
- Position wetland as final overflow destination in water management system
- Monitor water quality as indicator of upstream management success

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Wildlife species diversity (birds, amphibians, beneficial insects)
- Water quality maintenance
- Native plant establishment in buffer zone

### 4.2 Soil Carbon Amendment (Practice 336) - IF INDICATED

**Application:** If soil testing reveals severely degraded biology or structure, targeted amendments (compost, biochar) may accelerate recovery. Particularly relevant for swale berms post-earthwork.

### 4.3 Mulching (Practice 484) - TARGETED APPLICATION

**Application:** 
- Tree lines: Heavy mulching to suppress competition and retain moisture
- Disturbed areas post-earthwork
- High-traffic zones near barns and gates

### 4.4 Silvopasture (Practice 381)

**Application:** The integration of tree lines with grazing paddocks constitutes a silvopasture system. As trees mature:
- Shade reduces heat stress on livestock
- Tree fodder provides supplemental nutrition
- Improved animal welfare and productivity

### 4.5 Pest Management Conservation System (Practice 595) - PRIMARY

**Rationale:** Invasive species are present on the property, reducing pasture productivity and biodiversity. Integrated management through the regenerative system will address this without reliance on chemical inputs.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Grazing Management:** Targeted grazing pressure on invasive species (goats/sheep effective on woody invasives like blackberry)
- **Competition:** Diverse pasture overseeding and tree establishment outcompete invasives over time
- **Manual Removal:** Targeted removal of priority invasive species
- **Monitoring:** Track invasive species coverage as outcome metric

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Reduction in invasive species coverage (% of pasture)
- Increased desirable species diversity
- Reduced need for mechanical or chemical control over time

### 4.6 Irrigation Water Management (Practice 449) - PRIMARY

**Rationale:** Multiple water sources are available. The swale system transforms inefficient flood irrigation into a water harvesting system, reducing overall water needs as soil health improves.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Swales capture and infiltrate flood irrigation runoff
- As organic matter increases, soil water-holding capacity improves
- Monitor soil moisture to optimize irrigation timing and frequency
- Track reduction in irrigation needs over contract period

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Reduced irrigation frequency as soil improves
- Improved soil moisture retention between irrigation events
- Quantified water use efficiency gains

### 4.7 Irrigation Delivery System Redesign (Practices 587, 443, 388)

**Rationale:** The entire irrigation delivery system - from water entry point to pasture distribution - needs comprehensive redesign. Currently, water enters the property and is immediately lost to leakage and uncontrolled flow due to failing infrastructure. Fixing this at the source is essential before the downstream swale system can function as designed. This represents true systems thinking: efficient delivery → controlled distribution → swale water harvesting → infiltration → soil health.

**Relevant NRCS Practices:**
- **Structure for Water Control (587)** - Replacement of water control structures
- **Irrigation System, Surface and Subsurface (443)** - Surface irrigation improvements  
- **Irrigation Ditch Lining (388)** - If ditch improvements needed
- **Pipeline (516)** - If any pipe work is needed

**Current System (Problem):**

**Current Condition:**
- Two control boxes at water entry point, older than anyone can remember
- Box 1: Leaking significantly
- Box 2: In state of disrepair, also leaking
- Water lost to unintended areas before reaching pastures
- Inefficient, uncontrolled distribution

```

**Implementation Approach:**
- Document and photograph current infrastructure condition
- Design replacement control structures with NRCS technical assistance
- Replace both control boxes with modern water control structures
- Repair/improve main E/W distribution trench as needed
- Integrate with downstream swale system for complete water management

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Elimination of water loss from leaking structures
- Controlled water delivery to intended areas only
- Improved irrigation efficiency (quantified water savings)
- Reduced uncontrolled runoff entering pasture system
- Better timing and volume control for irrigation events

### 4.8 Upland Wildlife Habitat Management (Practice 645)

**Rationale:** Current pasture provides poor wildlife habitat due to low plant diversity and lack of cover. The integrated system creates connected habitat throughout the property.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Tree lines provide cover, nesting, and food sources
- Native wildflower understory in tree lines for pollinators
- Brush piles from clearing for small wildlife cover
- Wildlife corridor connecting tree lines to wetland buffer
- Diverse pasture provides foraging habitat

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Wildlife species observations (birds, pollinators, beneficial insects)
- Pollinator counts during bloom periods
- Habitat connectivity assessment

### 4.9 Grazing Infrastructure

Supporting infrastructure to enable grazing management:
- **Permanent Fencing:** Perimeter and major paddock divisions
- **Portable Electric:** Tree line exclusion, temporary subdivisions
- **Water System:** Livestock water access from barn sources to paddocks
- **Lanes/Alleys:** Access along swale lines if needed for animal movement

### 7.2 Swale and Tree Line System Design

**Earthwork Specifications:**
- **Swale Profile:** Shallow, wide swales (not deep ditches) to maximize infiltration
- **Berm Location:** Downhill side of each swale
- **Tree Planting Zone:** On and just below berm crest
- **Swale Capacity:** Designed to handle flood irrigation overflow events

**Experimental Design Element: Notched Swale Edges**

One innovative concept to test is "notching" the uphill edge of swales - creating tooth-like indentations that may improve water capture and infiltration.

```
STANDARD SWALE (top view):

    Water flow ──▶  ════════════════════════════════
                             SWALE (smooth edge)
                    ════════════════════════════════
                             BERM + TREES


NOTCHED SWALE (top view):

    Water flow ──▶  ══╗ ╔══╗ ╔══╗ ╔══╗ ╔══╗ ╔══╗ ╔══
                      ╚═╝  ╚═╝  ╚═╝  ╚═╝  ╚═╝  ╚═╝
                      notches create deeper pockets
                    ════════════════════════════════
                             BERM + TREES
```

**Hypothesis:** Notched edges may:
- Increase edge length = more infiltration surface area
- Create deeper pockets that concentrate water and push it into berms
- Direct seepage toward tree root zones rather than dissipating evenly
- Create microhabitat variation (wet pockets vs. drier ridges)
- Capture organic debris that builds soil in notches over time

**Testing Approach:**
- Construct 1-2 swales with notched design, remainder standard
- Compare infiltration rates, soil moisture retention, and tree establishment
- Document which design performs better for this context

**Design Parameters (to be refined):**
- Notch width: 2-3 ft
- Notch depth: 6-12" deeper than main swale channel
- Notch spacing: 10-20 ft intervals
- Notch orientation: Into uphill (water-catching) side of swale

**Status:** Experimental concept. This is an untested innovation that fits the pilot program's purpose of developing and documenting new approaches. Results - whether successful or not - will inform future silvopasture designs.

**Tree Line Composition (per ~550 ft row):**
| Layer | Species Examples | Function | Spacing |
|-------|------------------|----------|---------|
| **Canopy** | Oak, walnut, fruit trees | Long-term shade, nuts/fruit, wildlife | 30-40 ft |
| **Sub-canopy** | Mulberry, persimmon, elderberry | Fruit, wildlife, partial shade | 15-20 ft |
| **Nitrogen-fixers** | Black locust, alder, Siberian pea shrub | N-fixation, biomass, chop-and-drop | 10-15 ft |
| **Shrub layer** | Hazelnut, currant, native shrubs | Nuts, wildlife, diversity | 8-10 ft |
| **Herbaceous** | Comfrey, native wildflowers | Biomass, pollinators, soil biology | Understory |

**Electric Fence Management:**
- Single or double-strand portable electric wire runs parallel to tree lines
- Animals excluded from tree rows until trees are established (3-5 years)
- Allows biomass accumulation in tree rows for chop-and-drop mulching
- Fence can be removed once trees reach browse-resistant size

### 7.3 Irrigation Distribution System Design

**The Challenge:** How to evenly distribute flood irrigation water to all swales, not just the first one the water hits.

**Existing Infrastructure:** An 8" pipe already runs along the western edge of the paddocks (nursery/garden strip). This becomes the distribution backbone.

**Solution: 3-Zone Gated Distribution with Passive Cascade Overflow**

**How It Works:**
1. Open Gate 1 → Water fills Swale 1 → Overflows to Swale 2 → Zone 1 complete
2. Open Gate 2 → Water fills Swale 3 → Overflows to Swale 4 → Zone 2 complete  
3. Open Gate 3 → Water fills Swale 5 → Overflows to Swale 6 → Zone 3 complete

**Overflow System: 6" HDPE Riser Pipes**

Each swale has a vertical riser pipe that sets the overflow height. When water reaches the top of the riser, it drops in and exits through the berm to the next swale.

```
RISER OVERFLOW DETAIL (Cross-Section):

         │ 6" HDPE │   ← top cut level = overflow height
         │  RISER  │     (black HDPE = UV stable 25+ years)
         │         │
    ~~~~~│~~~~~~~~~│~~~~  ← water level when full
         │         │
         │    ●────┼────▶ 90° elbow below grade

                   │
                   └────▶ daylights in paddock below,
                          flows to next swale
```

**Why HDPE Riser Pipes:**
- Black HDPE = UV stable for 25+ years
- No vegetation management (nothing grows on pipe)
- No clogging (debris floats, doesn't enter)
- Invisible in landscape (just top visible above water)
- Adjustable (cut lower to change overflow height)
- Cheap to replace if ever needed (~$30-50 each)

**Infrastructure Cost:**

| Item | Quantity | Unit Cost | Total |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Slide gates (8" pipe) | 3 | $100 | $300 |
| 6" HDPE riser + elbow + horizontal | 5 | $40 | $200 |
| Fittings, connections | misc | -- | $100 |
| **Total irrigation distribution** | | | **~$600** |

**Outcomes:**
- Even water distribution to all swales via 3 zones
- Passive overflow = minimal management
- No vegetation/debris concerns with riser design
- Low-tech, low-cost, long-lasting
- "Just works" - open gate, walk away, water distributes itself

### 7.4 Grazing Calendar Framework

With 6-7 paddocks between swales, the rotation provides adequate rest periods:

| Season | Paddocks in Rotation | Days per Paddock | Rest Period | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|-------------|-------|
| **Spring** (Mar-May) | All 6-7 | 2-4 days | 18-24 days | Fast rotation during flush growth |
| **Summer** (Jun-Aug) | 4-5 (stockpile 2) | 3-5 days | 30-45 days | Slower growth, taller residuals |
| **Fall** (Sep-Nov) | All 6-7 | 3-5 days | 25-35 days | Moderate rotation, tree line biomass chop |
| **Winter** (Dec-Feb) | 2-3 (stockpiled) | 7-14 days | N/A | Graze stockpiled paddocks, hay supplement |

**Tree Line Integration:**
- Years 1-3: Animals excluded from tree lines via electric fence
- Years 4+: Limited access to established tree lines for browse, shade
- Biomass from tree prunings can be distributed in paddocks for animal impact

### 7.5 Animal Integration Options

*The specific livestock species is secondary to the regenerative system design. Options include:*

- **Cattle (small herd):** Highest impact for soil stimulation; 2-4 head appropriate for ~4 acres effective grazing
- **Sheep:** Lower impact, excellent for diverse forage utilization; 10-20 head appropriate
- **Goats:** Useful for brush/weed management; can combine with sheep
- **Multi-Species Rotation:** Sequential grazing maximizes forage utilization and parasite management
- **Poultry Following Ruminants:** Chickens follow grazers to spread manure, consume parasites, add fertility

**Stocking Rate Considerations:**
- Start conservative in Year 1 while system establishes
- Tree lines reduce effective grazing area by ~15-20%
- Increase stocking as soil health and forage production improve
- Target: 1 Animal Unit per 1-1.5 acres by Year 3-5

### Model Farm Objectives

This project is designed as a **model integrated silvopasture system** that addresses a significant gap: transforming conventional 2D pasture into a 3D regenerative powerhouse through tree line integration on contour swales.

While basic regenerative grazing resources are increasingly available, **practical models for integrating trees into pasture systems remain rare**. Everyone who hears about this project asks the same question: "How does the tree line system actually work?" This project will document exactly that - from swale construction through tree establishment to eventual integration with grazing.

The tree lines are not an add-on; they are the innovation that multiplies the impact of every other practice.

#### 1. Silvopasture Tree Line Innovation

**The Gap:** Most pasture-based regenerative systems operate in two dimensions - grass and grazing. This project transforms a 2D pasture into a **3D photosynthesis and biodiversity powerhouse** through integrated tree lines on contour swales.

**Why This Matters:**
Trees in a pasture system aren't just "nice to have" - they fundamentally change what's possible:

| 2D Pasture (Conventional) | 3D Silvopasture (This Project) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Single canopy layer (grass) | Multiple canopy layers (grass + shrubs + trees) |
| Shallow root systems | Deep + shallow roots accessing different soil horizons |
| Limited carbon sequestration | Dramatically increased carbon capture (above + below ground) |
| Minimal habitat diversity | Stacked habitat niches for wildlife, pollinators, beneficials |
| Exposed to sun/wind/weather | Microclimate modification (shade, windbreak, humidity) |
| Water runs off | Water captured by swales, accessed by deep tree roots |

**This Project Delivers:**
- Documented integration of contour swales with diverse tree lines
- Multi-species tree line design (nitrogen-fixers, biomass producers, canopy trees)
- Practical management of trees within grazing system (electric exclusion → eventual integration)
- Template for converting any pasture into silvopasture using swale-based tree establishment

**Target Audience:** Farmers and landowners asking "How do I actually integrate trees into my grazing system without the animals destroying them?"

#### 2. Low-Tech Flood Irrigation + Contour Swale Integration

**The Gap:** Conventional advice for irrigation efficiency assumes high-tech solutions (drip systems, sprinklers, sensors) or dismisses flood irrigation as hopelessly inefficient. But flood irrigation infrastructure already exists on millions of acres across the American West. Ripping it out for expensive alternatives isn't realistic for most small landowners.

**The Innovation:** This project keeps flood irrigation but redesigns the system to work *with* the landscape:

```
CONVENTIONAL FLOOD                    THIS PROJECT
(fight the landscape)                 (work with the landscape)

Water applied ──▶ Runs downhill   vs   Water applied ──▶ Captured by swale
              ──▶ Pools in low spots                  ──▶ Spreads along contour  
              ──▶ Runs off property                   ──▶ Infiltrates slowly
              ──▶ Wasted                              ──▶ Stored in soil
                                                      ──▶ Accessed by tree roots
                                                      ──▶ Available for weeks
```

**This Project Delivers:**
- Complete water flow redesign: entry point → efficient distribution → contour swale capture → passive infiltration
- Documentation of aging flood infrastructure rehabilitation (common challenge across the West)
- Quantified water retention: how long does soil stay moist between irrigation events?
- Low-tech, low-cost template that works with existing infrastructure

**The Core Problem:**

Currently, the property receives 2.5 days of irrigation water every two weeks. This *should* be adequate, but most of it runs off because the soil and landscape cannot absorb it fast enough. The water comes, the ground floods, and the excess leaves the property unused.

**The Vision:**

Transform the property's water absorption capacity so completely that 2.5 days feels like barely enough - because the swales, soil organic matter, and tree root systems can capture and store it all. Then, when neighboring properties don't need their irrigation days, that additional water can be absorbed too.

```
CURRENT STATE                         GOAL STATE

2.5 days water ──▶ Overwhelms land    2.5 days water ──▶ Fully absorbed
               ──▶ Runoff/waste                      ──▶ Stored in soil
               ──▶ "Too much water"                  ──▶ "Could use more"
                                                     ──▶ Neighbor's unused 
                                                         days = bonus capacity
```

This is the true measure of success: not using *less* water, but being able to *hold more*.

**The Design Challenge (Why This is a True Pilot):**

Establishing trees without drip irrigation is the critical unknown. Most silvopasture guides assume either:
- Drip irrigation during establishment, or
- Rainfall-dependent climates where flood irrigation isn't needed

This project will document the design process and outcomes of establishing trees using *only* flood irrigation and swale water harvesting in a Mediterranean climate with dry summers. 

**Design Variables to Test:**

| Variable | Options | What We'll Learn |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| **Swale dimensions** | Width, depth, profile | Storage capacity vs. earthwork cost |
| **Berm planting position** | Top of berm vs. swale edge | Moisture access for young trees |
| **Mulch depth** | 6" vs. 12" wood chips | Moisture retention between floods |
| **Species selection** | Drought-tolerant pioneers first | Which trees establish on flood-only? |
| **Irrigation timing** | Frequent short floods vs. long soaks | Infiltration vs. runoff tradeoff |
| **Soil amendments** | Compost, biochar in planting holes | Do amendments improve establishment? |

**Key Questions to Answer:**

- What swale dimensions provide adequate water retention for tree establishment?
- How does mulch depth affect moisture availability between flood events?
- Which tree species establish successfully without drip?
- What irrigation frequency is needed in Year 1 vs. Year 3?
- Can passive systems fully replace drip, or is supplemental watering needed in extreme conditions?
- How does water-holding capacity change as organic matter increases over the 5-year contract?

**Honest Assessment:** The final design is not yet complete. This project will develop, test, and document the approach - exactly what a pilot program should fund. Success means a replicable template; challenges encountered will be documented for others to learn from.

**Why Low-Tech Matters:**
- No pumps, timers, filters, or emitters to maintain
- No electricity required
- No plastic drip lines to replace every few years
- Gravity does the work
- Resilient to power outages and supply chain issues
- Affordable for small/beginning farmers

**Regional Relevance:** As water becomes increasingly scarce and contested in the American West, this model demonstrates that efficiency doesn't require high-tech solutions. It requires working with gravity and contour, not against them.

#### 3. Whole-Systems Integration

**The Gap:** Conservation programs often fund isolated practices. The Regenerative Pilot Program explicitly calls for bundled, whole-farm approaches - but the interactions between practices are rarely documented.

**This Project Delivers:**
- True systems integration where every element serves multiple functions:

| Element | Functions Served |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Swales** | Water capture, irrigation efficiency, tree establishment zones, paddock boundaries |
| **Tree Lines** | Shade, biomass, nitrogen fixation, wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, windbreak, deep water access |
| **Grazing** | Nutrient cycling, plant stimulation, residue incorporation, income, soil biology activation |
| **Cover Crops** | Living roots, nitrogen fixation, diversity, erosion control, pollinator forage |

- Documented interactions and synergies: swales water trees → trees shade pastures → shade improves animal welfare → animals fertilize trees → deep tree roots access subsoil water → leaf drop builds organic matter → organic matter holds water → reduced irrigation needs
- Proof that regenerative practices compound, not just add

#### 4. Contribution to MAHA Goals

**The Gap:** The Regenerative Pilot Program explicitly connects to "Make America Healthy Again" by supporting access to American-grown whole foods. Most program materials focus on large commodity operations.

**This Project Delivers:**
- Model for small-scale, local food production on regeneratively-managed land
- Demonstration that healthy soil → healthy pastures → healthy animals → healthy food
- Template applicable to the growing number of Americans seeking to produce food on small acreages

#### 5. Concrete Deliverables

Beyond individual farm success, this project commits to producing:

| Deliverable | Timeline | Audience |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Quarterly photo documentation | Ongoing | NRCS, public |
| Annual written summary (challenges, solutions, costs) | Each year | Other producers |
| Soil health data series (baseline → Year 5) | Contract period | NRCS, researchers |
| Minimum 2 site visits/field days per year | Years 2-5 | Local producers, NRCS |
| Final case study document | Year 5 | NRCS educational library |
| Consent for NRCS photography and publication | Ongoing | Program promotion |

**Outcome:** A complete, documented, replicable model that NRCS can point to when the next small landowner asks: "Can regenerative agriculture work on my 10 acres?"
