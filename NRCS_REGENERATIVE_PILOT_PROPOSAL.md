# NRCS Regenerative Pilot Program Proposal

## Fogs End Farm - Small-Scale Regenerative Model Farm

**Total Property Size:** 9.5 acres  
**Active Production Area:** 5 acres (back portion of property)  
**Primary Land Use:** Pasture (4.5 ac), Garden/Nursery (0.25 ac), Wetland (0.25 ac)  
**Program:** NRCS Regenerative Pilot Program (FY2026)  
**Funding Source:** EQIP ($400M pool) and/or CSP ($300M pool)

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal presents a comprehensive regenerative plan for the 5-acre back production area of a 9.5-acre property. The current pasture suffers from low soil organic matter, poor water-holding capacity, and limited biological activity. This project transforms a grass monoculture into a diverse, climate-resilient silvopasture system.

**Resource Concerns Addressed:**
- **Soil health:** Building organic matter, water-holding capacity, and biological activity
- **Water management:** Maximizing infiltration and retention of existing irrigation allocation
- **Biodiversity:** Transitioning from grass monoculture to diverse silvopasture with 30+ species
- **Carbon sequestration:** Building soil carbon through managed grazing and integrating trees for above- and below-ground storage
- **Climate resilience:** Deep-rooted trees, increased soil moisture retention, drought-tolerant species

**The project integrates:**
- **Contour swale system** (7 swales running E/W) to capture, slow, and infiltrate irrigation water
- **Diverse tree lines** (30+ species) on swale berms for biomass, shade, nitrogen fixation, and habitat
- **7 grazing paddocks** (6 between swales + 1 off-contour) with adaptive multi-paddock management
- **Wetland buffer zone** (0.25 ac, NW corner) for wildlife habitat
- **Garden/nursery area** (0.25 ac) for propagation of proven silvopasture genetics

This proposal prioritizes the regenerative system itself as a replicable model for small-scale integrated silvopasture, with production as a secondary outcome of healthy land function.

---

## Part 2: Whole-Farm Assessment Framework

### 2.1 Resource Concern Categories

The whole-farm assessment will address all NRCS resource concern categories:

#### Soil Resource Concerns
- **Soil Organic Matter Depletion (PRIMARY CONCERN):** Current pasture has low organic matter content resulting in poor water-holding capacity. Baseline testing will establish starting levels; target 1% increase over contract period. Every component of this system addresses organic matter building.
- **Water-Holding Capacity:** Directly linked to organic matter - soil currently drains quickly and does not retain moisture between irrigation events. Improved through organic matter building, living roots, and swale water harvesting.
- **Aggregate Stability:** Measured through soil health testing; improved via root systems and fungal networks from diverse plantings
- **Soil Biology:** Baseline biological activity assessment; enhanced through diverse plantings, reduced disturbance, and increased organic inputs from tree lines and managed grazing

#### Water Resource Concerns
- **Surface Water Quality:** Runoff management through vegetated buffers and improved infiltration
- **Groundwater Quality:** Nutrient management to prevent leaching
- **Water Quantity/Efficiency:** Improved water holding capacity through increased organic matter
- **Drainage/Infiltration:** Enhanced through soil structure improvements and cover systems

#### Natural Vitality (Biodiversity) Concerns
- **Habitat Diversity:** Multi-species pasture system supporting pollinators, beneficial insects, and wildlife
- **Plant Community Health:** Diverse perennial and annual species integration (30+ species in tree lines alone)
- **Ecosystem Function:** Carbon cycling, nutrient cycling, and water cycling as integrated system

#### Carbon Sequestration
- **Soil Carbon (PRIMARY):** Managed grazing builds soil carbon through root exudates, trampled residue, and manure incorporation; healthy pasture is a significant carbon sink independent of trees
- **Above-Ground Carbon:** Tree integration adds woody biomass storage; silvopasture stores 2-5x more carbon than grass-only systems
- **Below-Ground Carbon:** Deep-rooted perennial grasses and trees (oaks, chestnuts, persimmon) stabilize carbon in lower soil horizons

#### Climate Resilience
- **Drought Tolerance:** Deep-rooted trees access water during dry periods; increased soil organic matter improves water-holding capacity
- **Variable Conditions:** Diverse species mix provides insurance against climate variability; some species thrive in wet years, others in dry
- **Temperature Moderation:** Tree shade reduces heat stress on pasture and livestock; moderates soil temperature extremes

### 2.2 Site Characterization

#### Property Layout
- **Total Property:** 9.5 acres
- **Active Production Area:** Back 5 acres (focus of this proposal)
- **Dimensions:** 550 ft (E/W) x 400 ft (N/S)
- **Contour Orientation:** Runs approximately E/W

#### Existing Infrastructure
*(See [Appendix D.6](#d6-barns-and-infrastructure))*
- **SW Barn:** Running water (frost-free), hay storage, equipment, animal shelter
- **SE Barn:** Running water (frost-free), hay storage, animal shelter
- **Access Road:** South side of pasture (shared with irrigation infrastructure)
- **Irrigation System:** Flood-style irrigation along south access corridor

#### Water Features
- **Wetland:** NW corner, approximately 0.25 acres (requires delineation and buffer determination) *(See [Appendix D.2](#d2-wetland-nw-corner))*
- **Seasonally Wet Areas:** Some pasture areas hold water longer than others; require assessment to determine if jurisdictional wetlands or simply poorly drained soils
- **Irrigation Runoff:** Significant water management challenge from flood irrigation currently causing uncontrolled runoff across pasture

#### Wetland Delineation Required
NRCS wetland delineation requested to:
- Confirm boundaries of NW wetland
- Determine if seasonally wet pasture areas qualify as wetlands
- Establish appropriate buffer distances for earthwork
- Ensure Swampbuster compliance

#### Current Land Use
*(See [Appendix D.5](#d5-pasture-conditions), [Appendix D.7](#d7-garden-and-nursery))*
- **Pasture:** ~4.5 acres (continuous, to be subdivided)
- **No-Till Garden:** Located within production area
- **Nursery:** Located within production area
- **Wetland Buffer:** NW corner

#### Data to Gather with NRCS
- [ ] Soil survey data and soil types present
- [ ] Precise slope percentages for swale design

## Part 3: Primary Regenerative Practices

Based on the approved practice list and the specific site conditions (flood irrigation runoff, pasture subdivision needs, biodiversity goals), the following **bundled primary practices** form the core of this regenerative plan:

### 3.1 Grazing Management (Practice 528) - PRIMARY

**Rationale:** The cornerstone practice for pasture-based regenerative systems. Properly managed grazing is the most powerful tool for building soil health, cycling nutrients, and stimulating plant growth on pastureland.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Adaptive Multi-Paddock (AMP) Grazing System:** 7 paddocks total (6 in contour system + 1 off-contour on E side)
- **Paddock Size:** Approximately 0.5-0.65 acres each (based on ~50 ft spacing between swales)
- **High Stock Density, Short Duration:** Animals concentrated for brief periods (5 days per paddock) followed by extended rest (30 days)
- **Rest Period Management:** Recovery time based on plant growth stage, not calendar dates
- **Tree Line Exclusion:** Electric fencing keeps animals out of swale tree lines, protecting trees while allowing biomass to accumulate
- **Animal Impact as Tool:** Targeted trampling to incorporate residue, break soil caps, and stimulate biological activity

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Increased pasture productivity (forage dry matter per acre)
- Improved plant diversity and desirable species composition
- Reduced bare ground percentage
- Enhanced root depth and density

### 3.2 Contour Buffer Strips / Tree Establishment - PRIMARY (Multiple Practice Codes)

**Rationale:** The defining feature of this system. Contour swales address a critical existing resource concern: uncontrolled flood irrigation runoff currently causing erosion and water loss across the pasture. This water harvesting earthwork system will capture, slow, spread, and infiltrate runoff - keeping water on the landscape rather than losing it. The swale berms create productive silvopasture zones, directly addressing both soil AND water resource concerns simultaneously.

**Conservation Benefits of Earthwork:**
- **Eliminates uncontrolled runoff** from flood irrigation system
- **Increases water infiltration** and groundwater recharge
- **Reduces erosion** from current sheet flow across pasture
- **Extends water availability** for pastures and trees between irrigation events
- **Protects downstream wetland** by slowing and filtering water before arrival

**Relevant NRCS Practices:**
- **Contour Farming (330)** - Swale orientation follows contour
- **Hedgerow Planting (422)** - Diverse tree/shrub rows on swale berms
- **Riparian Herbaceous Cover (390)** - Vegetated swale channels
- **Tree/Shrub Establishment (612)** - Multi-species tree lines
- **Silvopasture (381)** - Integration of trees with grazing system
- **Grade Stabilization Structure (410)** - If swales include overflow management
- **Water Harvesting Catchment (636)** - Capturing runoff for beneficial use

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Earthwork:** 7-8 water harvesting swales on contour, running E/W across the 400 ft N/S dimension
- **Swale location:** Away from NW wetland, respecting buffer distances determined by NRCS wetland delineation
- **Spacing:** Approximately 50 ft between swales
- **Swale Function:** Capture, slow, spread, and infiltrate irrigation runoff
- **Tree Line Planting:** Diverse species on swale berms (north/downhill side of each swale channel)
- **Species Selection Goals:**
  - Nitrogen-fixing trees (alder, Siberian pea shrub, goumi)
  - Biomass/mulch production (willow, poplar - dense coppice on wet swale edge)
  - Shade canopy development (oak, chestnut, honey locust)
  - Fruit/nut production (fig, hazelnut, persimmon, mulberry)
  - Wildlife/pollinator habitat (serviceberry, native species, aromatic herbs)
  - Aromatic edge plantings (sage, lavender - dry uphill edge)

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Elimination of uncontrolled irrigation runoff
- Increased water infiltration and groundwater recharge
- Tree survival and growth rates
- Canopy cover percentage over time
- Biomass production from tree line prunings

**Estimated Cost:** $12,000-$15,000 for earthwork including access road (see budget)

### 3.3 Cover Crop (Practice 340) - PRIMARY

**Rationale:** Cover crops extend living root presence, fix atmospheric nitrogen, improve soil biology, and prevent erosion during vulnerable periods.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Pasture Overseeding:** Introduce diverse species into existing pasture sward
- **Multi-Species Mixes:** Combine grasses, legumes, and forbs for functional diversity
  - **Grasses:** Annual ryegrass, cereal rye, oats (seasonal nurse crops)
  - **Legumes:** Crimson clover, hairy vetch, winter peas (nitrogen fixation)
  - **Forbs/Brassicas:** Daikon radish, turnips, chicory (deep rooting, soil structure)
- **Seasonal Strategy:** Cool-season covers for fall/winter/spring; warm-season annuals if needed for summer gaps
- **Integration with Grazing:** Covers grazed as part of rotation, maximizing nutrient cycling

**Seeding Methods (low-tech, appropriate scale):**
- **Tow-behind broadcast spreader:** Pulled by zero-turn mower for efficient coverage
- **Drag harrow:** Light chain or harrow drag to scratch seed into soil surface
- **Animal trampling:** Move livestock through seeded area to press seed into soil
- **Frost seeding:** Broadcast on frozen ground in late winter; freeze-thaw cycles work seed in
- **Post-grazing overseed:** Seed immediately after grazing when residue is short and soil exposed

Equipment needs are minimal - tow-behind spreader and light drag harrow suitable for zero-turn mower (~$300-600 total, confirm eligibility with NRCS).

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Year-round living root presence
- Increased nitrogen availability from legume fixation
- Improved water infiltration rates
- Enhanced pollinator and beneficial insect habitat

### 3.4 Nutrient Management (Practice 590) - PRIMARY

**Rationale:** Proper nutrient cycling is essential for regenerative systems. The goal is to transition from external inputs to closed-loop nutrient cycling through biological processes.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Soil Testing Protocol:** Comprehensive baseline testing including standard fertility, organic matter, and biological indicators
- **Nutrient Budget Development:** Calculate inputs (nitrogen fixation, atmospheric deposition, any amendments) and outputs (harvest removal, animal products)
- **Animal-Driven Cycling:** Grazing management distributes manure and urine across paddocks
- **Amendment Strategy (if needed):** Targeted applications based on soil test results, prioritizing biological and mineral amendments over synthetic inputs
- **Legume Integration:** Nitrogen fixation as primary nitrogen source

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Stable or improving soil nutrient levels without synthetic fertilizer dependency
- Improved nutrient use efficiency
- Reduced potential for nutrient runoff or leaching

### 3.5 Forage Harvest Management (Practice 511) - SUPPORTING PRIMARY

**Rationale:** For pasture systems, how and when forage is harvested (grazed or mechanically) directly impacts plant health, regrowth, and soil carbon inputs.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Grazing Height Management:** "Take half, leave half" principle - never graze below optimal residual height
- **Recovery Before Regrazing:** Plants must fully recover root reserves before next grazing event
- **Seasonal Adjustments:** Longer rest periods during slow growth; may include hay harvest in peak growth
- **Stockpiling:** Accumulate fall growth for extended grazing season

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Maintained plant vigor and stand persistence
- Maximized root:shoot ratio and carbon sequestration
- Extended grazing season reducing hay dependency

---

## Part 4: Supporting Practices

The following practices support the primary regenerative management system:

### 4.1 Wetland Wildlife Habitat Management (Practice 644)

**Location:** NW corner, approximately 0.25 acres *(See [Appendix D.2](#d2-wetland-nw-corner))*

**Rationale:** The existing wetland is a significant ecological asset. Enhancing native vegetation improves wildlife habitat and biodiversity. Note: wetland is uphill from contour swales and not part of the irrigation/grazing system.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Maintain appropriate buffer from grazing activity (permanent exclusion fencing)
- Plant water-loving native species (elderberry, willow, sedges, rushes)
- Enhance habitat connectivity between wetland and tree lines via west edge vegetation
- Maintain as separate habitat feature, not integrated with pasture management

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Wildlife species diversity (birds, amphibians, beneficial insects)
- Native plant establishment and survival

### 4.2 Soil Carbon Amendment (Practice 336) - IF INDICATED

**Application:** If soil testing reveals severely degraded biology or structure, targeted amendments (compost, biochar) may accelerate recovery. Particularly relevant for swale berms post-earthwork.

### 4.3 Mulching (Practice 484) - TARGETED APPLICATION

**Application:** 
- Tree lines: Heavy mulching to suppress competition and retain moisture
- Disturbed areas post-earthwork
- High-traffic zones near barns and gates

### 4.4 Silvopasture (Practice 381)

**Application:** The integration of tree lines with grazing paddocks constitutes a silvopasture system. As trees mature:
- Shade reduces heat stress on livestock
- Tree fodder provides supplemental nutrition
- Improved animal welfare and productivity

### 4.5 Pest Management Conservation System (Practice 595) - PRIMARY

**Rationale:** Invasive species and internal parasites are present challenges. Integrated management through the regenerative system will address these without reliance on chemical inputs.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Grazing Management:** Targeted grazing pressure on invasive species *(See [Appendix D.5](#d5-pasture-conditions), Photos D.5.4-D.5.5)*
- **Poultry Following Ruminants:** Mobile poultry (chickens) follow 3-4 days behind ruminant grazers to:
  - Break parasite cycles by consuming larvae in manure
  - Control pest insects (flies, ticks, grasshoppers)
  - Scratch and spread manure for faster nutrient cycling
  - Add additional fertility through poultry manure
- **Competition:** Diverse pasture overseeding and tree establishment outcompete invasives over time
- **Manual Removal:** Targeted removal of priority invasive species
- **Monitoring:** Track invasive species coverage as outcome metric

**Infrastructure Required:**
- Electronet poultry fencing (164 ft sections) for rotational paddock management
- Mobile shelter (chicken tractor or skid-mounted coop) for predator protection and easy movement

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Reduction in invasive species coverage (% of pasture)
- Reduced internal parasite load in ruminants (fecal egg counts)
- Increased desirable species diversity
- Reduced need for mechanical or chemical control over time

### 4.6 Irrigation Water Management (Practice 449) - PRIMARY

**Rationale:** Multiple water sources are available. The swale system transforms inefficient flood irrigation into a water harvesting system, reducing overall water needs as soil health improves.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Swales capture and infiltrate flood irrigation runoff
- As organic matter increases, soil water-holding capacity improves
- Monitor soil moisture to optimize irrigation timing and frequency
- Track reduction in irrigation needs over contract period

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Reduced irrigation frequency as soil improves
- Improved soil moisture retention between irrigation events
- Quantified water use efficiency gains

### 4.7 Irrigation Delivery System Redesign (Practices 587, 443, 388)

**Rationale:** The entire irrigation delivery system - from water entry point to pasture distribution - needs comprehensive redesign. Currently, water enters the property and is immediately lost to leakage and uncontrolled flow due to failing infrastructure. Fixing this at the source is essential before the downstream swale system can function as designed.

**Relevant NRCS Practices:**
- **Structure for Water Control (587)** - Replacement of water control structures
- **Irrigation System, Surface and Subsurface (443)** - Surface irrigation improvements  
- **Irrigation Ditch Lining (388)** - If ditch improvements needed
- **Pipeline (516)** - If any pipe work is needed

**Current System (Problem):**

```

```

**Current Condition:** *(See [Appendix D.3](#d3-irrigation-control-boxes-250-w-of-garden))*
- Two control boxes at water entry point, older than anyone can remember
- Box 1: Leaking significantly
- Box 2: In state of disrepair, also leaking
- Water lost to unintended areas before reaching pastures
- Inefficient, uncontrolled distribution

**Proposed System (Solution):**

(~250' W of garden)                                       
```

**Implementation Approach:**
- Document and photograph current infrastructure condition
- Design replacement control structures with NRCS technical assistance
- Replace both control boxes with modern water control structures
- Repair/improve main E/W distribution trench as needed
- Integrate with downstream swale system for complete water management

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Elimination of water loss from leaking structures
- Controlled water delivery to intended areas only
- Improved irrigation efficiency (quantified water savings)
- Reduced uncontrolled runoff entering pasture system
- Better timing and volume control for irrigation events

### 4.8 Upland Wildlife Habitat Management (Practice 645)

**Rationale:** Current pasture provides poor wildlife habitat due to low plant diversity and lack of cover. The integrated system creates connected habitat throughout the property.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Tree lines provide cover, nesting, and food sources
- Native wildflower understory in tree lines for pollinators
- Brush piles from clearing for small wildlife cover
- Habitat connectivity between tree lines and wetland buffer via west edge plantings
- Diverse pasture provides foraging habitat

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Wildlife species observations (birds, pollinators, beneficial insects)
- Pollinator counts during bloom periods
- Habitat connectivity assessment

### 4.9 Grazing Infrastructure

Supporting infrastructure to enable grazing management:
- **Perimeter Fencing:** Existing N/S fencing on both sides (N side needs minor updates, S side good condition); new E/W fencing needed at N and S ends of paddock area to close off contour system
- **Paddock Entry:** Removable panels at E/W fence lines for livestock movement into paddocks
- **Paddock 7 Separation:** N/S fence at E end of contour paddocks separates Paddock 7 from contour system
- **Primary Paddock Access:** ~0.25 ac N/S corridor between garden and paddocks; provides livestock access from SW barn to all contour paddocks (1-6)
- **Tree Line Protection:** Semi-permanent electric fencing along tree lines with zoned control (only active paddock energized); removable wire design allows tree line access for pruning and maintenance
- **Water System (Paddocks 1-6):** Buried water line from SW barn through Primary Paddock Access corridor; frost-free hydrants at each swale berm
- **Water System (Paddock 7):** Uses existing frost-free at SE barn
- **Paddock 7:** Existing perimeter fencing in good condition; minor reconfiguration as needed

### 7.2 Swale and Tree Line System Design

**Earthwork Scope (Comprehensive):**

| Component | Quantity | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Standard swales** | 5 (Swales 2-6) | Contour swales with berms, full tree lines |
| **S Access road/swale** | 1 (Swale 1) | Wide swale with 8-10 ft compacted ATV surface, tree line on N edge |
| **N Access road/swale** | 1 (Swale 7) | 8-10 ft compacted ATV surface, tree line on south edge only |
| **Irrigation distribution** | 1 system | 6 gates (one per swale), piping from 8" main to swales |
| **Total swale linear feet** | ~2,800 ft | 7 swales x ~400 ft each |
| **Total tree line linear feet** | ~2,800 ft | 7 tree lines x ~400 ft each |

**Earthwork Specifications:**
- **Swale Profile:** Shallow, wide swales (not deep ditches) to maximize infiltration
- **Berm Location:** Downhill side of each swale
- **Tree Planting Zone:** On and just below berm crest
- **Swale Capacity:** Designed to handle flood irrigation overflow events
- **Contour Precision:** Swales graded level on contour across full 400 ft width; all spillway notches at same elevation for even overflow.
- **S Access Road (Swale 1):** Wider swale profile, compacted ATV surface (8-10 ft), tree line on north edge only (south side faces barns)
- **N Access Road (Swale 7):** Wider swale profile, compacted ATV surface (8-10 ft), tree line on south edge only (north side is property edge)

**Tree Line Design - Two-Phase Approach:**

The tree line follows a dense establishment phase that transitions to a productive mature system over 10 years.

**Cross-Section (S to N, uphill to downhill):**

**PHASE 1: ESTABLISHMENT PLANTING (Year 1)**

*Goal: Create microclimate, build soil, suppress weeds, provide fast shade*

| Layer | Species | Spacing | Purpose | Fate by Year 5-7 |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Nurse/Emergent** | Poplar | 10-15 ft | Fast shade, windbreak | Pollard at Year 5, remove by Year 10 |
| **N-fixers (dense)** | Alder, Siberian pea shrub, Goumi | 5-8 ft | Nitrogen, biomass, soil building | Thin to 15-20 ft or remove |
| **Swale channel** | Willow | 2-3 ft | Coppice biomass, water uptake | Maintain dense permanently |
| **S edge (uphill)** | Sage, Comfrey | 2 ft | Aromatics, biomass, pollinators | Permanent |
| **N edge (downhill)** | Lavender, Comfrey | 2 ft | Aromatics, biomass, pollinators | Permanent |

**PHASE 2: MATURE SYSTEM (Year 10+)**

*Goal: Productive silvopasture with staggered fodder, fruit, nuts, shade*

One "Unit" = 40-50 ft (spacing between canopy trees)

| Layer | Species | Final Spacing | Qty per Unit | Primary Function | Production Timing |
|-------|---------|---------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Canopy (High)** | Oak, Chestnut, Honey locust | 40-50 ft | 1 | Shade, nuts, fodder pods | Fall (pods, nuts) |
| **Sub-canopy (Med)** | Pear, Persimmon, Fig, Mulberry | 15-20 ft | 2-3 | Fruit, fodder leaves | Summer-Fall |
| **Shrub (Low)** | Hazelnut, Serviceberry, Goumi, Currant, Gooseberry | 8-10 ft | 4-5 | Nuts, berries, N-fixation | Summer-Fall |
| **S edge** | Sage, Comfrey | 2 ft | many | Aromatics, biomass chop-drop | Spring-Fall |
| **N edge** | Lavender, Comfrey | 2 ft | many | Aromatics, biomass, pollinators | Spring-Fall |
| **Swale channel** | Willow | 2-3 ft | dense | Coppice biomass, browse | Year-round coppice |

**FODDER/PRODUCTION CALENDAR:**

| Month | Available Production |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Early Spring** | Willow browse, comfrey (first chop) |
| **Late Spring** | Comfrey, goumi flowers (pollinators) |
| **Early Summer** | Mulberry leaves + fruit, gooseberry, currant |
| **Mid Summer** | Fig fruit, comfrey (second chop), serviceberry |
| **Late Summer** | Pear fruit drop |
| **Early Fall** | Honey locust pods, hazelnuts |
| **Late Fall** | Persimmon (post-frost), chestnuts, oak acorns |
| **Winter** | Willow browse (limited), stockpiled pasture |

**Management Timeline:**
- **Years 1-3:** Allow all species to establish; support species provide shade and fertility
- **Years 4-7:** Begin thinning support species as permanent canopy develops; coppice willows for biomass
- **Years 8-10+:** Remove pollarded nurse trees (poplars) as oaks/chestnuts reach functional size; mature system emerges
- **Ongoing:** Maintain willow coppice in swale channels (1-2x/year)

**Livestock Safety Note:** All species selected are livestock-safe. Elderberry confined to wetland buffer only (not grazed).

**Electric Fence Management:**
- Two-strand electric fence runs parallel to tree lines (both sides of tree row)
- Zoned system allows only active paddock to be energized
- Wire is removable for tree line maintenance (pruning, mulching, harvesting)
- Animals excluded from tree rows; fence may remain long-term to protect understory plantings

### 7.3 Irrigation Distribution System Design

**The Challenge:** How to evenly distribute flood irrigation water to all swales, not just the first one the water hits.

**Existing Infrastructure:** An 8" pipe already runs along the western edge of the paddocks (nursery/garden strip). This becomes the distribution backbone.

**Solution: 3-Zone Gated Distribution with Passive Cascade Overflow**

                                SOUTH (uphill - irrigation source)
```

**How It Works (water flows north, downhill):**
1. Open gates for Swales 1-2 → Paddocks 1-2 watered
2. Open gates for Swales 3-4 → Paddocks 3-4 watered
3. Open gates for Swales 5-7 → Paddocks 5-6 watered → Excess exits north edge

**Watering Schedule Options:**
- **Standard:** 2.5 days every 2 weeks (one deep soak)
- **Split for tree establishment:** 1 day + 1.5 days alternating weeks (more frequent, lighter soaks)

Split schedule may benefit newly planted trees during establishment years.

**Overflow System: Spillway Notches**

Each berm has spillway notches every 10 ft. When water reaches the spillway level, it flows through the notches and sheets down the berm face into the paddock below.

```

**Spillway Design:**
- Contractor grades spillway notches into berm every 10 ft, all at same level
- 40 spillways per swale × 6 swales = 240 spillways total
- Fine-tune spillway levels with hand grading if needed after first irrigation
- No pipe or hardware required — just graded earth

**Infrastructure Cost:**

| Item | Quantity | Unit Cost | Total |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Slide gates (8" pipe) | 6 | $100 | $600 |
| Fittings, connections | misc | -- | $100 |
| **Total irrigation distribution** | | | **~$700** |

**Outcomes:**
- Even water distribution across full 400 ft swale width
- Passive overflow = minimal management
- Low-tech, low-cost, no plastic
- Fine-tune spillway levels by hand if settling occurs

### 7.4 Grazing Calendar Framework

With 7 paddocks and a 5-day rotation, the system provides adequate rest with minimal management complexity:

| Season | Paddocks | Days per Paddock | Rotation Length | Rest Period | Notes |
|--------|----------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Spring** (Mar-May) | All 7 | 4-5 days | 28-35 days | 24-30 days | May tighten rotation during flush growth |
| **Summer** (Jun-Aug) | All 7 | 5 days | 35 days | 30 days | Standard rotation; irrigation supports regrowth |
| **Fall** (Sep-Nov) | All 7 | 5 days | 35 days | 30 days | Standard rotation |
| **Winter** (Dec-Feb) | 3-4 (stockpiled) | 7-10 days | N/A | N/A | Graze stockpiled paddocks, hay supplement |

**Paddock Access:**
- Paddocks 1-6 (contour system): Access SW barn via W corridor
- Paddock 7 (E side, off-contour): Access SE barn directly
- Animals move between paddocks every 5 days (6 moves per month)

**Tree Line Integration:**
- Electric fencing excludes animals from tree lines to protect understory plantings
- Biomass from tree prunings can be distributed in paddocks for animal impact
- Fencing may remain long-term to protect productive understory (comfrey, aromatics, etc.)

### 7.5 Animal Integration Options

**Grazing Animals:**

Rotational grazing with ruminants (cattle, sheep, or goats) is essential to the regenerative system. The specific animals and management arrangement will be determined based on availability and circumstances — the infrastructure (fencing, water, paddocks) is designed to accommodate any common grazing livestock.

- **Poultry integration:** Chickens following ruminants to spread manure, consume parasites, and add fertility

**Stocking Rate:**
- Start conservative in Year 1 while system establishes
- Adjust stocking as soil health and forage production improve

## Part 10: Qualifications and Commitment

### Beginning Farmer Status

This application is submitted as a **beginning farmer** under USDA definitions, which qualifies for enhanced cost-share rates (90% vs. standard 75%).

**Beginning Farmer Qualification Criteria:**

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Has not operated a farm or ranch for more than 10 years | Qualifies |
| Does not have a farm number yet | Will obtain from FSA as part of application |
| Substantially participates in farm operation | Owner-operator, primary decision-maker |
| New agricultural enterprise on this property | Yes - silvopasture system built from scratch |

**Why Beginning Farmer Status Matters for This Project:**

The enhanced 90% cost-share rate is essential for project viability. A 25% producer contribution ($7,000-$13,000) would create a significant barrier to implementing this comprehensive regenerative system. The 10% contribution ($2,800-$5,300) makes the project feasible while still ensuring producer investment and commitment.

This is exactly the type of project the beginning farmer provisions are designed to support: a new producer establishing a regenerative system from the ground up, contributing to program learning, and creating a replicable model for others.

### Producer Commitment

- Implement regenerative plan as designed
- Participate in all required soil testing
- Maintain records of grazing rotations, observations, and management decisions
- Allow NRCS site visits for progress verification
- Share outcomes data to contribute to program learning

### Model Farm Objectives

This project is designed as a **model integrated silvopasture system** that demonstrates how to transform conventional pasture into productive silvopasture through tree line integration on contour swales.

While basic regenerative grazing resources are increasingly available, **practical models for integrating trees into pasture systems remain rare**. Everyone who hears about this project asks the same question: "How does the tree line system actually work?" This project will document exactly that - from swale construction through tree establishment to eventual integration with grazing.

The tree lines are not an add-on; they are the innovation that multiplies the impact of every other practice.

#### 1. Silvopasture Tree Line Integration

This project transforms a 2D pasture into a **3D silvopasture system** through integrated tree lines on contour swales.

**Why This Matters:**
Trees in a pasture system aren't just "nice to have" - they fundamentally change what's possible:

| 2D Pasture (Conventional) | 3D Silvopasture (This Project) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Single canopy layer (grass) | Multiple canopy layers (grass + shrubs + trees) |
| Shallow root systems | Deep + shallow roots accessing different soil horizons |
| Limited carbon sequestration | Dramatically increased carbon capture (above + below ground) |
| Minimal habitat diversity | Stacked habitat niches for wildlife, pollinators, beneficials |
| Exposed to sun/wind/weather | Microclimate modification (shade, windbreak, humidity) |
| Water runs off | Water captured by swales, accessed by deep tree roots |

**This Project Delivers:**
- Documented integration of contour swales with diverse tree lines
- Multi-species tree line design (nitrogen-fixers, biomass producers, canopy trees)
- Practical management of trees within grazing system (electric exclusion → eventual integration)
- Template for converting any pasture into silvopasture using swale-based tree establishment

**Target Audience:** Farmers and landowners asking "How do I actually integrate trees into my grazing system without the animals destroying them?"

#### 2. Low-Tech Flood Irrigation + Contour Swale Integration

This project demonstrates how to maximize flood irrigation efficiency using contour swales — working *with* existing infrastructure rather than replacing it with expensive alternatives.

```
CONVENTIONAL FLOOD                    THIS PROJECT
(fight the landscape)                 (work with the landscape)

Water applied ──▶ Runs downhill   vs   Water applied ──▶ Captured by swale
              ──▶ Pools in low spots                  ──▶ Spreads along contour  
              ──▶ Runs off property                   ──▶ Infiltrates slowly
              ──▶ Wasted                              ──▶ Stored in soil
                                                      ──▶ Accessed by tree roots
                                                      ──▶ Available for weeks
```

**This Project Delivers:**
- Complete water flow redesign: entry point → efficient distribution → contour swale capture → passive infiltration
- Documentation of aging flood infrastructure rehabilitation (common challenge across the West)
- Quantified water retention: how long does soil stay moist between irrigation events?
- Low-tech, low-cost template that works with existing infrastructure

**The Core Problem:**

Currently, the property receives 2.5 days of irrigation water every two weeks. This *should* be adequate, but most of it runs off because the soil and landscape cannot absorb it fast enough. The water comes, the ground floods, and the excess leaves the property unused.

**The Vision:**

Transform the property's water absorption capacity so completely that 2.5 days feels like barely enough - because the swales, soil organic matter, and tree root systems can capture and store it all. Then, when neighboring properties don't need their irrigation days, that additional water can be absorbed too.

```
CURRENT STATE                         GOAL STATE

2.5 days water ──▶ Overwhelms land    2.5 days water ──▶ Fully absorbed
               ──▶ Runoff/waste                      ──▶ Stored in soil
               ──▶ "Too much water"                  ──▶ "Could use more"
                                                     ──▶ Neighbor's unused 
                                                         days = bonus capacity
```

This is the true measure of success: not using *less* water, but being able to *hold more*.

**A Proven Approach Applied to Local Conditions:**

The core practices in this proposal — contour swales, silvopasture, managed grazing — are well-established with decades of successful implementation worldwide. The design applies these proven techniques to the specific conditions of the Rogue Valley: Mediterranean climate, flood irrigation infrastructure, and small-scale acreage.

**Why This Design Works:**

| Design Element | How It Addresses the Challenge |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Contour swales** | Capture and hold flood irrigation water that currently runs off unused |
| **Trees on berms** | Elevated above waterlogging, roots access moisture stored below |
| **Heavy mulch (12"+)** | Retains moisture between irrigation events, reduces evaporation |
| **Drought-tolerant species** | Selected specifically for Mediterranean dry summers |
| **Flood-tolerant species in channels** | Willows thrive in wet/dry cycles, provide coppice biomass |
| **Split irrigation option** | More frequent watering during tree establishment if needed |

**Documentation Value:**

While the practices are proven, this project provides valuable regional documentation:
- Performance data for specific species in Rogue Valley conditions
- Practical guidance for small-acreage flood irrigation silvopasture
- Replicable template for similar properties in the region

**Why Low-Tech Matters:**
- No pumps, timers, filters, or emitters to maintain
- No electricity required
- No plastic drip lines to replace every few years
- Gravity does the work
- Resilient to power outages and supply chain issues
- Affordable for small/beginning farmers

**Regional Relevance:** As water becomes increasingly scarce and contested in the American West, this model demonstrates that efficiency doesn't require high-tech solutions. It requires working with gravity and contour, not against them.

#### 3. Whole-Systems Integration

This project demonstrates true systems integration where every element serves multiple functions:

| Element | Functions Served |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Swales** | Water capture, irrigation efficiency, tree establishment zones, paddock boundaries |
| **Tree Lines** | Shade, biomass, nitrogen fixation, wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, windbreak, deep water access |
| **Grazing** | Nutrient cycling, plant stimulation, residue incorporation, income, soil biology activation |
| **Cover Crops** | Living roots, nitrogen fixation, diversity, erosion control, pollinator forage |

- Documented interactions and synergies: swales water trees → trees shade pastures → shade improves animal welfare → animals fertilize trees → deep tree roots access subsoil water → leaf drop builds organic matter → organic matter holds water → reduced irrigation needs
- Proof that regenerative practices compound, not just add

#### 4. Soil and Habitat Regeneration Model

This project demonstrates how integrated pasture and tree management transforms degraded land into a functioning ecosystem.

**This Project Delivers:**
- Documented soil health improvements: organic matter, water-holding capacity, biological activity
- Habitat creation through multi-layer tree lines: canopy, understory, shrub, and herbaceous layers
- Wildlife corridor connecting wetland to tree lines via west edge plantings
- Transition from low-diversity grass monoculture to diverse silvopasture with 30+ plant species
- Template for small-acreage landowners seeking to regenerate marginal or underutilized pasture

#### 5. Concrete Deliverables

Beyond individual farm success, this project commits to producing:

| Deliverable | Timeline | Audience |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Quarterly photo documentation | Ongoing | NRCS, public |
| Annual written summary (challenges, solutions, costs) | Each year | Other producers |
| Soil health data series (baseline → Year 5) | Contract period | NRCS, researchers |
| Minimum 2 site visits/field days per year | Years 2-5 | Local producers, NRCS |
| Final case study document | Year 5 | NRCS educational library |
| Consent for NRCS photography and publication | Ongoing | Program promotion |

**Outcome:** A documented model for integrating silvopasture tree lines with managed grazing — applicable to any small-acreage pasture system regardless of irrigation method. The tree line design, species selection, grazing integration, and establishment techniques are broadly replicable.

When landowners ask: "How do I add trees to my pasture without the animals destroying them?" — this project provides the answer.

#### 6. Regional Source for Proven Silvopasture Genetics

Landowners interested in silvopasture often struggle to find appropriate plant material. This project addresses that by testing and propagating species suited to integration with livestock — trees and shrubs that tolerate grazing pressure, establish without intensive irrigation, and thrive in working pasture conditions.

**This Project Provides:** This project's garden/nursery area (0.25 acres) and the silvopasture system itself become a source for identifying which species and varieties succeed in Rogue Valley conditions. The knowledge gained — and the plant material propagated from proven survivors — can then be shared with other landowners attempting similar systems.

**What This Project Will Document and Share:**

| Category | Species Examples | Knowledge Generated |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Nitrogen-Fixers** | Alder, Siberian pea shrub, goumi | Which establish without drip irrigation? Which tolerate both periodic flooding and summer drought? |
| **Livestock-Safe Shade Trees** | Oak, honey locust, mulberry, chestnut, pear | Growth rates, browse tolerance, time to functional shade |
| **Fodder/Browse Species** | Willow, honey locust, mulberry | Palatability, regrowth after grazing, coppice response |
| **Biomass Producers** | Poplar, willow | Establishment from cuttings, coppice frequency (1-2x/year?), regrowth rates |
| **Pollinator/Beneficial Habitat** | Serviceberry, native shrubs | Integration with grazing, wildlife response |

**Why Provenance and Local Adaptation Matter:**

An "alder" from a humid coastal nursery and one selected from dry-summer survivors may be the same species on paper, but perform dramatically differently when:
- Subjected to 4+ months of summer drought
- Irrigated via periodic flooding rather than drip
- Integrated with grazing livestock
- Expected to survive deer pressure during establishment

This project will test multiple sources of key species, document which perform best, and propagate from the survivors. Over time, this creates a locally-adapted genetic resource that doesn't currently exist.

**The Testing Approach:**

| Element | Method | Knowledge Outcome |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **Provenance trials** | Plant multiple sources of key species, track survival and growth | Which seed sources perform best in Rogue Valley silvopasture? |
| **Individual selection** | Mark exceptional performers in the swale system | Which specific trees should become mother stock? |
| **Stress testing** | Minimal coddling - flood irrigation only, no drip, early livestock exposure | What actually survives real silvopasture conditions vs. nursery conditions? |
| **Multi-generation observation** | Propagate from survivors, track next generation | Do adapted genetics pass to offspring? |

**Sharing the Knowledge:**

The goal is not commercial nursery production, but ensuring that other landowners can access:

1. **Proven species recommendations** - Not generic lists, but specific guidance based on documented performance in this climate and management context
2. **Adapted plant material** - Cuttings, seeds, or divisions from plants that have demonstrated success in silvopasture conditions
3. **Establishment guidance** - What worked, what failed, and why - shared freely with anyone attempting similar systems
4. **Ongoing learning exchange** - As other landowners install silvopasture, their observations feed back into collective understanding

**Why This Matters for the Pilot Program:**

The Regenerative Pilot Program aims to develop models that spread. Documenting species performance and sharing adapted genetics is a **force multiplier** - every plant shared carries embedded knowledge from this project's successes and failures. This is how regenerative agriculture scales: not through mandates, but through practitioner networks built on shared learning and proven, locally-adapted genetics.

**Outcome:** A regional knowledge base and genetic resource that makes silvopasture adoption more accessible for subsequent landowners - because the trial-and-error of species selection has already been done and documented.
